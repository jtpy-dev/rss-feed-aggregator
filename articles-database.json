A few simple checks before making a purchase can make all the difference in avoiding a scam and keeping your money safe.”</p>\n\n<p>Online content, such as fake websites, advertisements, social media, and mobile apps, were the most common method used by scammers for initial contact, resulting in $122 million in losses, or 47 per cent of overall scam losses.</p>\n\n<p>Some shopping scams involve the compromise of social media accounts to reach unsuspecting victims. Compromised social media accounts are increasingly used by scammers to target victims’ personal networks, particularly on Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>After gaining access, scammers impersonate the account holder to promote scams such as fake ticket sales, ‘fire sales’, grant offers, and investment schemes.</p>\n\n<p>They further compromise friends’ accounts by requesting one-time codes under false pretences, enabling a chain of account takeovers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"media media--type-accc-image media--view-mode-accc-large-thumbnail\">\n      <img alt=\"Compromised social media account scams\" class=\"img-fluid image-style-large\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/sites/www.accc.gov.au/files/styles/large/public/2025-11/Social%20media%20account%20compromise%20.png?itok=l9j2veSJ\" title=\"Scammers use compromised social media account\" width=\"262\" />\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p><sub>Example of a social media post from a compromised account, advertising a ‘fire sale’ of items.</sub></p>\n\n<p>\"We continue to urge Australians to verify who they are communicating with online, as scammers leverage trusted relationships and social platforms to manipulate people into handing over money and personal information,” Ms Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>“You should be aware that online friend accounts can be compromised, so avoid clicking on any links and always do your own checks before paying money.

SPSA and its industry members applied to the ACCC to have their collaboration in relation to this scheme be exempt from some of Australia’s competition laws. The ACCC may grant an exemption, called an ‘authorisation’, if it finds there is an overall public benefit.</p>\n\n<p>“As the scheme aims to acquire and broaden the current instore and kerbside trial collection programs for soft plastic recycling, we’ve determined that it will likely result in some soft plastics being diverted from landfill,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.</p>\n\n<p>“We consider this is an environmental benefit.”</p>\n\n<p>Industry participants will pay a fee based on how much soft plastic packaging they generate each year.</p>\n\n<p>“It is clear from the ACCC’s consultation process that many Australians want to recycle soft plastic packing and are concerned about its environmental impacts,” Mr Keogh said.</p>\n\n<p>“The recycling and collection options currently available to consumers are limited, and we consider that the SPSA scheme is an important way to expand those choices.”</p>\n\n<p>Broader issues of policy and regulations around soft plastics, including decisions about whether to introduce mandatory regulations, are beyond the scope of the ACCC’s role as the competition regulator and administrative decision-maker for the current application.</p>\n\n<p>“We don’t consider that the SPSA scheme will delay or deter other regulatory approaches to soft plastic stewardship,” Mr Keogh said.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The ACCC’s exemption is subject to the following conditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SPSA must complete annual public reporting about the performance of the scheme to ensure its transparency;</li>\n<li>The scheme must be independently reviewed in the third and seventh year of its operation and these reviews must consider recommendations for improvements to the scheme’s operations and governance;</li>\n<li>SPSA’s board must include at least two independent directors; and</li>\n<li>SPSA cannot enter into exclusive contracts with processors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/authorisations-and-notifications-registers/authorisations-register/soft-plastic-stewardship-australia-limited\">Soft Plastic Stewardship Australia Limited</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Note to editors</h2>\n\n<p>The ACCC is not an environmental regulator and does not regulate the creation or use of soft plastic packaging, nor does it create or manage recycling schemes.</p>\n\n<p>The Australian Government, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/packaging/reforming-packaging-regulation\">Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water</a>, is working to reform Australia’s packaging regulations to minimise packaging waste and pollution and build a circular economy for packaging. This reform is separate to this scheme.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC’s role as Australia’s competition regulator includes assessing applications for competitors to work together, called ‘authorisations’. Broadly, the ACCC may grant an exemption when it is satisfied that the public benefit from the conduct outweighs any public detriment.</p>\n\n<p>Where ACCC authorisation is granted, it provides statutory protection from court action for certain conduct by competitors that might otherwise raise concerns under the Competition and Consumer Act.</p>\n\n<p>SPSA sought an exemption as some of the activities planned through the scheme involve competitors working together, which can sometimes risk breaching Australia’s competition laws.</p>\n\n<p>The authorisation and exemption role is limited to the exemption from specific sections of the Act, and, in this instance, authorisation is granted only in respect of Division 1 of Part IV and sections 45 and 47 of the Act.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>From 2011 to 2022, a return-to-store soft plastics collection program called ‘REDcycle’ partnered with major supermarkets to provide collection points for consumers to return used soft plastic packaging to stores for collection and recycling.</p>\n\n<p>REDcycle was funded by supermarkets and retail brands from several industries, including food and grocery, clothing and electronics, and at the time of its collapse, had approximately 192 participants in its program.</p>\n\n<p>After the collapse of the REDcycle program in 2022, the ACCC <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-authorises-major-supermarkets-to-continue-cooperation-on-soft-plastics-recycling\">authorised</a>&nbsp;ALDI, Coles and Woolworths to work together as part of the Soft Plastics Taskforce to pilot instore collections and process the stockpile of soft plastics that was left.

The ACCC may grant an exemption, called an ‘authorisation’, if it finds there is an overall public benefit.\n“As the scheme aims to acquire and broaden the current instore and kerbside trial collection programs for soft plastic recycling, we’ve determined that it will likely result in some soft plastics being diverted from landfill,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.\n“We consider this is an environmental benefit.”\nIndustry participants will pay a fee based on how much soft plastic packaging they generate each year.\n“It is clear from the ACCC’s consultation process that many Australians want to recycle soft plastic packing and are concerned about its environmental impacts,” Mr Keogh said.\n“The recycling and collection options currently available to consumers are limited, and we consider that the SPSA scheme is an important way to expand those choices.”\nBroader issues of policy and regulations around soft plastics, including decisions about whether to introduce mandatory regulations, are beyond the scope of the ACCC’s role as the competition regulator and administrative decision-maker for the current application.\n“We don’t consider that the SPSA scheme will delay or deter other regulatory approaches to soft plastic stewardship,” Mr Keogh said.\nThe ACCC’s exemption is subject to the following conditions:\nSPSA must complete annual public reporting about the performance of the scheme to ensure its transparency;\nThe scheme must be independently reviewed in the third and seventh year of its operation and these reviews must consider recommendations for improvements to the scheme’s operations and governance;\nSPSA’s board must include at least two independent directors; and\nSPSA cannot enter into exclusive contracts with processors.\nMore information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at\nSoft Plastic Stewardship Australia Limited\n.\nNote to editors\nThe ACCC is not an environmental regulator and does not regulate the creation or use of soft plastic packaging, nor does it create or manage recycling schemes.\nThe Australian Government, including the\nDepartment of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water\n, is working to reform Australia’s packaging regulations to minimise packaging waste and pollution and build a circular economy for packaging. This reform is separate to this scheme.\nThe ACCC’s role as Australia’s competition regulator includes assessing applications for competitors to work together, called ‘authorisations’. Broadly, the ACCC may grant an exemption when it is satisfied that the public benefit from the conduct outweighs any public detriment.\nWhere ACCC authorisation is granted, it provides statutory protection from court action for certain conduct by competitors that might otherwise raise concerns under the Competition and Consumer Act.\nSPSA sought an exemption as some of the activities planned through the scheme involve competitors working together, which can sometimes risk breaching Australia’s competition laws.\nThe authorisation and exemption role is limited to the exemption from specific sections of the Act, and, in this instance, authorisation is granted only in respect of Division 1 of Part IV and sections 45 and 47 of the Act.\nBackground\nFrom 2011 to 2022, a return-to-store soft plastics collection program called ‘REDcycle’ partnered with major supermarkets to provide collection points for consumers to return used soft plastic packaging to stores for collection and recycling.\nREDcycle was funded by supermarkets and retail brands from several industries, including food and grocery, clothing and electronics, and at the time of its collapse, had approximately 192 participants in its program.\nAfter the collapse of the REDcycle program in 2022, the ACCC\nauthorised\nALDI, Coles and Woolworths to work together as part of the Soft Plastics Taskforce to pilot instore collections and process the stockpile of soft plastics that was left. The Taskforce was designed as a temporary arrangement to precede the development of a broader industry-wide stewardship program. The Soft Plastics Taskforce is chaired by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.\nThe ACCC granted a\nfurther authorisation\nwith conditions in February 2025 with respect to the Soft Plastics Taskforce and processing of the stockpile, which is due to expire on 31 July 2026.\nOn 11 August 2025, the ACCC released a\ndraft determination\nproposing to grant authorisation, with conditions, for eight years. The ACCC also granted interim authorisation allowing SPSA to:\nset (but not collect) the levy;\narrange for services to operate the scheme (e.g. issue a request for information to processors); and\nshare operational information with Coles, Woolworths, ALDI, so SPSA can prepare to take over existing collections run by Soft Plastics Taskforce.\nUnder this authorisation, SPSA intends to take over and expand the pilot instore collection program being run by the Soft Plastics Taskforce, as well as providing kerbside collections and potential drop off facilities.\nRelease number\n126/25\nGeneral enquiries\nSubmit an online enquiry\nto ask a question or you can\nmake a report\nto help us understand where there are problems.\nMedia enquiries\nmedia@accc.gov.au or 1300 138 917.

I begin by acknowledging the Traditional Custodians of lands, waterways and skies across Australia. I pay my respects to the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and Bunurong people, on whose country we meet today, and honour their culture and Elders, past and present. I also extend my respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are here today.</p>\n\n<p>It is a pleasure to be partnering with Monash University to deliver this inaugural Australian Competition Summit. And to bring together, from across the world, people who understand and commit our working lives to competition law and economics. Who know the importance of evidencing competition in operation and the benefits it brings.</p>\n\n<p>This summit is timely for many reasons. Next week we will mark the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the ACCC which began operations on 6 November 1995 with the amalgamation of the&nbsp;Trade Practices Commission&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Prices Surveillance Authority. The landmark competition legal and policy reforms of the early 1990s that ushered in the ACCC delivered extended coverage of competition law, new access and infrastructure regulation, and important national competition policy actions. And for three decades, that approach has proved robust and adaptable.<i> </i>But today’s economic, societal and geopolitical developments present new challenges and require renewed commitment and shared insights on how we promote competition and protect consumers.</p>\n\n<p>30 years ago, I was closely engaged in the reforms to move Australia from monopoly to duopoly in telecommunications services. I had provided advice to the Commonwealth Government on the rights and immunities of carriers to be legislated to enable rapid expansion of telecommunications networks.</p>\n\n<p>After, I was subsumed in the negotiation of the interconnection and facilities access agreement for Optus (the then shareholders were Cable &amp; Wireless, Bell South and Continental Cablevision) with Telstra.</p>\n\n<p>By 1995, I had moved on to negotiating agreements with Movie Studios and sports right holders to secure the content for Optus Vision pay tv services.</p>\n\n<p>Those experiences taught me important lessons about the necessary regulatory frameworks, the critical technical and engineering elements for interconnection and interoperability and the difficulty of securing the foundations for successful entry. What strikes me today is that while technology, business models and markets have changed fundamentally, the challenges we faced and the mistakes we may have made remain relevant.</p>\n\n<p>As chair of the ACCC, this year has arguably been the most interesting of my three years in the role. The level of disruption in competition law and policy, the significant expansion and critical status of global digital platforms, the push to net-zero transition, and domestic and global productivity and cost-of-living concerns, are just a few of the forces shaping the ACCC’s competition work. Work that includes implementing merger reform, regulating infrastructure in concentrated markets, making a panoply of statutory decisions and running major enforcement cases.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of rapid and fundamental change, it is clear to me that we must not simply react to disruptive forces. We must lead with principle and purpose, informed by a strong evidence base.</p>\n\n<p>So, this Summit is timely. It brings us together to understand the lessons from the past and the challenges of the present. And to look forward, to test ideas, and to share emerging approaches.</p>\n\n<h3>The promise of competition</h3>\n\n<p>One of the key challenges that the ACCC is focused upon is that around the world, trust in institutions and governments is declining.</p>\n\n<p>A recent survey of more than 33,000 people across 28 countries (including Australia), showed that a majority of respondents hold a moderate or high sense of grievance. A belief that the system favours the privileged – that business and government, including regulators, serve a select few and act in ways that hurt the community. And only a third believe that the next generation will be better off<a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside this decline in trust, we are also seeing signs that consumer awareness and expectations of competition are changing. In Australia, public attention on sectors such as aviation, supermarkets and digital services reflects an increased scrutiny of household budgets in the context of uncertainty and high cost-of-living. But it also reflects the expectation that competition should deliver tangible outcomes on price, choice, quality and service.</p>\n\n<p>This expectation matters. It is enshrined in the object of our Competition and Consumer Act, that the promotion of competition is not an end in itself. Rather, that we work to promote competition to enhance the welfare of our community. And in this time of disruption, and diminishing consumer trust, it is more important than ever that we deliver on our mandate. That we strongly articulate the case for competition in a contested public policy environment. That we demonstrate the benefits of regulatory interventions to protect the process of competition. And that we ensure that our work delivers outcomes that are valued by the communities we serve.</p>\n\n<p>To kick start today’s discussions, I would like to use this speech to reflect on the ways in which we can lead to fulfil this responsibility:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>through collaboration with our international partners</li>\n<li>through change with right-sized regulation</li>\n<li>through action with robust competition enforcement, including merger control &nbsp;</li>\n<li>and through disruption using new approaches to anticipate and prevent harm &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>International partnerships: leading through collaboration</h3>\n\n<p>First to leadership through collaboration with our international partners.</p>\n\n<p>It is a privilege to be joined at this Summit by regulators, experts, policy makers, advisers, and academics from across the Asia-Pacific region, North America, United Kingdom and Europe.</p>\n\n<p>As Chair of the ACCC, I have learnt and benefited from our engagement in the international competition community as we each seek answers to very similar questions and challenges. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While the ACCC undertakes investigations independently our effectiveness is strengthened by the trusted relationships built over many years of international engagement.</p>\n\n<p>Through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Competition Network, our long-standing program with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and newer collaborations such as the PINCCER network, an important forum for competition, consumer and economic regulators across the Pacific – we are sharing intelligence, common challenges and new ways of working.</p>\n\n<p>These relationships help us to align elements of reform where appropriate. To identify emerging risks before harm becomes entrenched. And to ensure that competition law is grounded in strong forensic discipline, the best economic analysis and a vision for expanded application, as markets transform at an extraordinary pace.</p>\n\n<h3>Right-sized regulation: leading through reform</h3>\n\n<p>While overseas jurisdictions may operate within different legal traditions, economic pressures and political contexts – competition regulators worldwide face similar tensions. How to be the tough cop on the beat as expected by the community without being viewed as over restrictive. How to be firm without abandoning proportionality. And how to enable dynamism and economic growth without giving licence to harm.</p>\n\n<p>At the ACCC, we are navigating this with a commitment to right-sized regulation. That is, intervention that is rigorous where harm is greatest and proportionate to risk. And advocating for targeted reform to advance the protection and promotion of competition and the diversification of innovation.</p>\n\n<p>This means advocating for both the introduction of new legislation where it is needed, and the removal or updating of regulation that is no longer fit for purpose. This principle is in action at the ACCC across our broad range of work in merger reform, digital platforms, telecommunications, product safety and scams prevention.</p>\n\n<p><i>Merger reform</i></p>\n\n<p>When the Treasurer introduced the new merger regime to Parliament late last year, he described it as a reform directed at boosting competition and productivity.</p>\n\n<p>These reforms seek to strike the right balance between seeing and preventing the small number of anti-competitive acquisitions, while allowing those that are unlikely to raise competition issues to proceed promptly and with certainty. Importantly, the design of the new regime – and the ACCC’s committed approach to its delivery &nbsp;– has focused on regulatory timeliness, transparency and predictability. This includes clear processes for engaging with parties, competing businesses, suppliers, customers and the broader community.</p>\n\n<p>The new regime aims to give businesses greater clarity, consumers greater confidence and aligns Australia with best practice in merger control across OECD economies. And it is a topic we will be discussing in more depth later today.</p>\n\n<p><i>Digital platforms</i></p>\n\n<p>Right-sizing regulation is also at the centre of our recommendations for digital platform competition measures. This proposed regulatory framework, closely aligned to the UK model, includes targeted service-specific codes of conduct for designated critical intermediary platforms.</p>\n\n<p>This model can respond quickly to technological and business model change, support pro-competitive innovation through interoperability and contestability, provide more choice and lower cost for Australian consumers and businesses and be designed to be coherent with the regulatory frameworks being developed and implemented in other jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p>Such a targeted code-based regime would complement competition law enforcement to ensure that Australians can enjoy the benefits of competitive digital services.</p>\n\n<p><i>Telecommunications</i></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in telecommunications, as new technologies have emerged, the ACCC has right-sized regulation by adjusting our settings to ensure we only regulate when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in response to technological change and the rollout of the NBN, we no longer regulate wholesale services providing access to Telstra’s copper network. We have also significantly cut back wholesale regulation of telecommunications transmission services.</p>\n\n<p>This change in settings has been in response to significant industry investment in fibre – driven by cloud computing, hyperscale data centres, and growing demand for enterprise connectivity.</p>\n\n<p><i>Product safety</i></p>\n\n<p>We also have advocated for, and support the discipline of, right-sizing regulation in our product safety remit. Following enabling amendment to the Australian Consumer Law, the ACCC is conducting prioritised review of international safety standards to assess where they provide the same or greater protection than Australian national standards. This will allow businesses supplying products in Australia to comply by conforming to international standards, including as they change over time. This will reduce compliance costs, enable access to global supply chains, and increase consumer choice <i>without</i> compromising safety.</p>\n\n<p>Across all of this work, the principle is the same: regulation that is fit for purpose, proportionate in design and implementation, and directed at the greatest harms to consumers.</p>\n\n<h3>Leadership through action: competition enforcement</h3>\n\n<p>Which leads me to my next point: demonstrating our leadership through competition enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>In August at our Regulatory Conference Margrethe Vestager said in relation to ex-ante regulation, that policy without legislative obligation and sanctions is just a suggestion. By extension, enforcement action is how competition agencies demonstrate, case-by-case, that business is accountable for anti-competitive behaviour and that harm will be addressed. Strong enforcement record is necessary for building public trust.</p>\n\n<p>At the ACCC, our enforcement work over the past year reflects this discipline. And it reflects the breadth of tools available – from compliance engagement and education to enforceable undertakings and litigation – to address conduct that harms consumers and the competitive process. And to achieve outcomes that are proportionate to the conduct and its harm.</p>\n\n<p>Just this week, we accepted an enforceable undertaking for resale price maintenance that strikes a balance between addressing the conduct and its harm, while being fair to the relatively small trader involved. We take resale price maintenance very seriously because it stops retailers from competing on price and can increase what consumer pay.</p>\n\n<p>Our recent action against Google demonstrates in practice our ability to combine enforcement tools to achieve an outcome that most benefits competition and consumers in a timely way.</p>\n\n<p>As most in this room will already know, Google admitted to breaching Australia’s competition law in relation to pre-installation and placement of Google Search on Android devices and agreed to jointly submit to the court that it should pay a penalty of $55 million. It will be a matter for the court to determine appropriate orders, including penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, we also secured a court-enforceable undertaking from Google, with commitments to modify the way it distributes Google Search in Australia. These commitments are designed to deliver tangible benefits, providing the opportunity for choice for millions of Australian consumers. And opening up competition on the merits.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to these cases, through our action against cartels, we have been clear that collusion – in any sector and at any scale – is incompatible with competition and will be met with serious consequences.</p>\n\n<p>We have recently seen the Full Federal Court uphold decisions in favour of the ACCC in our cartel cases against Delta Building Automation and BlueScope Steel.</p>\n\n<p>We have also announced two new civil cartel proceedings in recent months: one alleging price fixing in the supply of fresh produce to ALDI. Another alleging price fixing and/or supply restriction by major suppliers of mobile crane services in Sydney. These cases cut to the core of markets that matter to Australians – our food supply chains and the construction and infrastructure sectors that underpin our economy.</p>\n\n<p>And beyond these cases, we continue to pursue other important matters before the courts, including our misuse of power case against Mastercard and our civil cartel case against Spotless and Ventia.</p>\n\n<p>In each of these matters, the decision to take action is driven by public interest and grounded in evidence – a clear assessment of harm, competitive impact and consumer welfare.</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, these proceedings illustrate the complexity and force of contested competition litigation. They also show our resolve to take action where important to secure specific and general deterrence of anti-competitive conduct in all its forms.</p>\n\n<h3>Leadership through disruption: new approaches to anticipate and prevent harm</h3>\n\n<p>As I noted at the start of this speech, leadership in the promotion of competition is not just about reacting to disruptive forces but influencing and shaping outcomes. As such, competition enforcement involves not only responding to reported harm, but proactively anticipating risk, detecting patterns, and disrupting anticompetitive conduct before its impact becomes entrenched.</p>\n\n<p>This approach is seen in our work in cartels, where last month, we announced a partnership with the NSW government to obtain rich procurement data sets.&nbsp; We will apply data analysis led techniques to identify suspicious patterns to detect and deter bid rigging in public procurement.</p>\n\n<p>We have also drawn on lessons from global experiences. Ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Japan Fair Trade Commission uncovered an alleged bid-rigging cartel involving contracts worth nearly 540 million Yen. Several criminal convictions were secured, including a 22-month suspended prison sentence for a former government executive, and fines imposed by the Japan Fair Trade Commission totalling 3.3 billion Yen.</p>\n\n<p>The Spanish and South Korean competition agencies are now using advanced data analysis and AI applied to procurement data to identify the majority of bid rigging cases that they investigate and prosecute.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>To conclude, we a community of regulators, policy makers, expert economists and lawyers, researchers and advisers come together at a critical time. Faced by the challenges of significant technological and business model disruption, increasing market concentration, geopolitical uncertainty, conflicting public policy pressures and the need to build community trust we have a critical role to play. It is important to both articulate clearly and demonstrate in action what competition means and the benefits it brings.</p>\n\n<p>We understand we will be most effective when law design and enforcement is principled, proportionate and grounded in the public interest. By sharing our experiences and learning from each other, we advance our stewardship of competition policy and law at a pivotal time.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" />\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Edelman Trust Institute, <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/au/trust/2025/trust-barometer\">2025 Edelman Trust Barometer: Trust and the crisis of grievance Australia report</a>, July 2025</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

I begin by acknowledging the Traditional Custodians of lands, waterways and skies across Australia. I pay my respects to the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and Bunurong people, on whose country we meet today, and honour their culture and Elders, past and present. I also extend my respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are here today.\nIt is a pleasure to be partnering with Monash University to deliver this inaugural Australian Competition Summit. And to bring together, from across the world, people who understand and commit our working lives to competition law and economics. Who know the importance of evidencing competition in operation and the benefits it brings.\nThis summit is timely for many reasons. Next week we will mark the 30\nth\nanniversary of the ACCC which began operations on 6 November 1995 with the amalgamation of the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority. The landmark competition legal and policy reforms of the early 1990s that ushered in the ACCC delivered extended coverage of competition law, new access and infrastructure regulation, and important national competition policy actions. And for three decades, that approach has proved robust and adaptable.\nBut today’s economic, societal and geopolitical developments present new challenges and require renewed commitment and shared insights on how we promote competition and protect consumers.\n30 years ago, I was closely engaged in the reforms to move Australia from monopoly to duopoly in telecommunications services. I had provided advice to the Commonwealth Government on the rights and immunities of carriers to be legislated to enable rapid expansion of telecommunications networks.\nAfter, I was subsumed in the negotiation of the interconnection and facilities access agreement for Optus (the then shareholders were Cable & Wireless, Bell South and Continental Cablevision) with Telstra.\nBy 1995, I had moved on to negotiating agreements with Movie Studios and sports right holders to secure the content for Optus Vision pay tv services.\nThose experiences taught me important lessons about the necessary regulatory frameworks, the critical technical and engineering elements for interconnection and interoperability and the difficulty of securing the foundations for successful entry. What strikes me today is that while technology, business models and markets have changed fundamentally, the challenges we faced and the mistakes we may have made remain relevant.\nAs chair of the ACCC, this year has arguably been the most interesting of my three years in the role. The level of disruption in competition law and policy, the significant expansion and critical status of global digital platforms, the push to net-zero transition, and domestic and global productivity and cost-of-living concerns, are just a few of the forces shaping the ACCC’s competition work. Work that includes implementing merger reform, regulating infrastructure in concentrated markets, making a panoply of statutory decisions and running major enforcement cases.\nIn the context of rapid and fundamental change, it is clear to me that we must not simply react to disruptive forces. We must lead with principle and purpose, informed by a strong evidence base.\nSo, this Summit is timely. It brings us together to understand the lessons from the past and the challenges of the present. And to look forward, to test ideas, and to share emerging approaches.\nThe promise of competition\nOne of the key challenges that the ACCC is focused upon is that around the world, trust in institutions and governments is declining.\nA recent survey of more than 33,000 people across 28 countries (including Australia), showed that a majority of respondents hold a moderate or high sense of grievance. A belief that the system favours the privileged – that business and government, including regulators, serve a select few and act in ways that hurt the community. And only a third believe that the next generation will be better off\n[1]\n.\nAlongside this decline in trust, we are also seeing signs that consumer awareness and expectations of competition are changing. In Australia, public attention on sectors such as aviation, supermarkets and digital services reflects an increased scrutiny of household budgets in the context of uncertainty and high cost-of-living. But it also reflects the expectation that competition should deliver tangible outcomes on price, choice, quality and service.\nThis expectation matters. It is enshrined in the object of our Competition and Consumer Act, that the promotion of competition is not an end in itself. Rather, that we work to promote competition to enhance the welfare of our community. And in this time of disruption, and diminishing consumer trust, it is more important than ever that we deliver on our mandate. That we strongly articulate the case for competition in a contested public policy environment. That we demonstrate the benefits of regulatory interventions to protect the process of competition. And that we ensure that our work delivers outcomes that are valued by the communities we serve.\nTo kick start today’s discussions, I would like to use this speech to reflect on the ways in which we can lead to fulfil this responsibility:\nthrough collaboration with our international partners\nthrough change with right-sized regulation\nthrough action with robust competition enforcement, including merger control\nand through disruption using new approaches to anticipate and prevent harm\nInternational partnerships: leading through collaboration\nFirst to leadership through collaboration with our international partners.\nIt is a privilege to be joined at this Summit by regulators, experts, policy makers, advisers, and academics from across the Asia-Pacific region, North America, United Kingdom and Europe.\nAs Chair of the ACCC, I have learnt and benefited from our engagement in the international competition community as we each seek answers to very similar questions and challenges.\nWhile the ACCC undertakes investigations independently our effectiveness is strengthened by the trusted relationships built over many years of international engagement.\nThrough the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Competition Network, our long-standing program with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and newer collaborations such as the PINCCER network, an important forum for competition, consumer and economic regulators across the Pacific – we are sharing intelligence, common challenges and new ways of working.\nThese relationships help us to align elements of reform where appropriate. To identify emerging risks before harm becomes entrenched. And to ensure that competition law is grounded in strong forensic discipline, the best economic analysis and a vision for expanded application, as markets transform at an extraordinary pace.\nRight-sized regulation: leading through reform\nWhile overseas jurisdictions may operate within different legal traditions, economic pressures and political contexts – competition regulators worldwide face similar tensions. How to be the tough cop on the beat as expected by the community without being viewed as over restrictive. How to be firm without abandoning proportionality. And how to enable dynamism and economic growth without giving licence to harm.\nAt the ACCC, we are navigating this with a commitment to right-sized regulation. That is, intervention that is rigorous where harm is greatest and proportionate to risk. And advocating for targeted reform to advance the protection and promotion of competition and the diversification of innovation.\nThis means advocating for both the introduction of new legislation where it is needed, and the removal or updating of regulation that is no longer fit for purpose. This principle is in action at the ACCC across our broad range of work in merger reform, digital platforms, telecommunications, product safety and scams prevention.\nMerger reform\nWhen the Treasurer introduced the new merger regime to Parliament late last year, he described it as a reform directed at boosting competition and productivity.\nThese reforms seek to strike the right balance between seeing and preventing the small number of anti-competitive acquisitions, while allowing those that are unlikely to raise competition issues to proceed promptly and with certainty. Importantly, the design of the new regime – and the ACCC’s committed approach to its delivery  – has focused on regulatory timeliness, transparency and predictability. This includes clear processes for engaging with parties, competing businesses, suppliers, customers and the broader community.\nThe new regime aims to give businesses greater clarity, consumers greater confidence and aligns Australia with best practice in merger control across OECD economies. And it is a topic we will be discussing in more depth later today.\nDigital platforms\nRight-sizing regulation is also at the centre of our recommendations for digital platform competition measures. This proposed regulatory framework, closely aligned to the UK model, includes targeted service-specific codes of conduct for designated critical intermediary platforms.\nThis model can respond quickly to technological and business model change, support pro-competitive innovation through interoperability and contestability, provide more choice and lower cost for Australian consumers and businesses and be designed to be coherent with the regulatory frameworks being developed and implemented in other jurisdictions.\nSuch a targeted code-based regime would complement competition law enforcement to ensure that Australians can enjoy the benefits of competitive digital services.\nTelecommunications\nMeanwhile, in telecommunications, as new technologies have emerged, the ACCC has right-sized regulation by adjusting our settings to ensure we only regulate when necessary.\nFor example, in response to technological change and the rollout of the NBN, we no longer regulate wholesale services providing access to Telstra’s copper network.

The ACCC’s authorisation allows the parties to collaborate and prepare for any suspension or disruption of cash-in-transit services.\nOn 25 June 2025, the ACCC\ngranted authorisation\nwith conditions for the ABA, and the major banks and retailers (‘the Funding Parties’) to provide financial contributions to Armaguard and discuss and implement operational sustainability and efficiency measures. The ACCC also authorised the parties to discuss and reach agreement on (but not implement) development of an independent pricing mechanism in respect of each (future) cash services agreement with each of the Funding Parties. Authorisation was granted with conditions until 30 June 2026 but does not extend to the implementation of any pricing proposal – the ACCC expects a further application for authorisation of implementation of the pricing proposal in due course.\nRelease number\n117/25\nGeneral enquiries\nSubmit an online enquiry\nto ask a question or you can\nmake a report\nto help us understand where there are problems.\nMedia enquiries\nmedia@accc.gov.au or 1300 138 917.

This may create challenges for fully replenishing southern gas storage facilities ahead of winter 2026.”</p>\n\n<p><b>Regional supply-demand outlook for quarter 1 2026 (PJ)</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"media media--type-accc-image media--view-mode-default\">\n      <img alt=\"Bar graph showing regional gas supply and demand for Q1 2026\" class=\"img-fluid\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/sites/www.accc.gov.au/files/2025-10/gas-regional-supply-demand-outlook-q1-2026.png\" width=\"1016\" />\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small\">\n<p>Source: ACCC analysis of data obtained from gas producers in July 2025 and of the domestic demand forecast (Step Change scenario) from AEMO, Gas Statement of Opportunities (GSOO), March 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. The quantity required to meet long-term LNG SPAs includes feed gas requirements (such as fuel) required to produce LNG. LNG producers' uncontracted gas has been zeroed out when negative as this gas must be acquired from the domestic market, either as additional gas production, purchases or a reduction in exports which would have a net 0 impact on the forecast.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gas suppliers and users have signed more long-term supply deals so far this year, for supply in 2026 and 2027.</p>\n\n<p>But the report found, despite this, the total amount of gas secured under these contracts remains below levels seen before 2022. Most of the contracts are for only one year.</p>\n\n<p>Prices offered by gas producers for 2026 supply eased in the first half of 2025, falling by an average of 2 per cent to $13.12 per gigajoule (GJ) compared to the second half of 2024. In comparison, prices offered by gas retailers for 2026 supply averaged $14.33/GJ.</p>\n\n<p>For 2027, the average price under producer contracts was $13.93/GJ, while retailer contracts averaged $14.30/GJ. Suppliers contracted a total of 18 PJ of gas for 2026 supply, and 21 PJ for 2027.</p>\n\n<h2>Gas policy measures have not made a material difference for local users</h2>\n\n<p>The report also reviewed the impact of the Gas Market Code (Gas Code), the Commonwealth Heads of Agreement with LNG exporters (HoA) and the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM), following the ACCC’s initial observations reported in June 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC has found these measures may have added some gas to the local market, but, overall, they have not materially improved outcomes for gas users.</p>\n\n<p>“There are limits to what the gas policy measures can achieve on their own if the underlying causes of inadequate supply and ineffective competition are not addressed,” Ms Brakey said.</p>\n\n<p>“In addition, they may also be having some unintended incentive effects and causing inefficiencies in gas supply negotiations.”</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC’s review has found that the 2023 reforms to the ADGSM appear to have reduced LNG producers’ incentives to make a net contribution to the domestic market.</p>\n\n<p>These changed incentives appear to have had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the risk of domestic supply shortfalls.</p>\n\n<p>Further, since the 2022 HoA was entered into, the volumes of gas being offered and supplied by the LNG producers to the domestic market have declined over time, while LNG export volumes have increased.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC’s <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/accc-submission-commonwealth-gas-market-review.pdf\">submission</a> to the Gas Market Review outlines the ACCC’s experience and observations arising from the inquiry to inform government consideration of reforms to promote longer-term gas market efficiency and measures to ensure that, in the interim, the Code, ADGSM and HoA are fit for purpose.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>In 2017, the Australian Government directed the ACCC to conduct a <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/inquiries-and-consultations/gas-inquiry-2017-30\">wide-ranging inquiry</a> to improve transparency of the gas market in Australia and support its efficient operation, and to monitor gas supply.

    "full_text": "Date\n1 October 2025\nTopics\nEnergy\nGas supply on Australia’s east coast is expected to improve in the first quarter of 2026, but the outlook still depends on how much uncontracted gas LNG producers decide to export, according to the\nACCC’s latest gas inquiry report\nreleased today.\nThe report indicates a gas supply surplus of between 2 and 24 petajoules (PJ) is expected for the east coast, depending on what the LNG producers decide to do with their uncontracted gas.\n“The Queensland LNG producers have reported a reduction in contracted LNG exports, and now expect to have 22 PJ of uncontracted gas available in the first quarter of next year,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.\n“Given ongoing concerns about sufficiency of domestic gas supply, the ACCC will be monitoring whether and how this gas is offered to domestic buyers.”\n“Despite the improvement, the supply-demand outlook remains tight in the southern states,” Ms Brakey said.\n“For the first time, southern gas producers are not expecting to produce surplus gas in the first quarter of the year, when demand is usually at its lowest. This may create challenges for fully replenishing southern gas storage facilities ahead of winter 2026.”\nRegional supply-demand outlook for quarter 1 2026 (PJ)\nSource: ACCC analysis of data obtained from gas producers in July 2025 and of the domestic demand forecast (Step Change scenario) from AEMO, Gas Statement of Opportunities (GSOO), March 2025.\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding. The quantity required to meet long-term LNG SPAs includes feed gas requirements (such as fuel) required to produce LNG. LNG producers' uncontracted gas has been zeroed out when negative as this gas must be acquired from the domestic market, either as additional gas production, purchases or a reduction in exports which would have a net 0 impact on the forecast.\nGas suppliers and users have signed more long-term supply deals so far this year, for supply in 2026 and 2027.\nBut the report found, despite this, the total amount of gas secured under these contracts remains below levels seen before 2022. Most of the contracts are for only one year.\nPrices offered by gas producers for 2026 supply eased in the first half of 2025, falling by an average of 2 per cent to $13.12 per gigajoule (GJ) compared to the second half of 2024. In comparison, prices offered by gas retailers for 2026 supply averaged $14.33/GJ.\nFor 2027, the average price under producer contracts was $13.93/GJ, while retailer contracts averaged $14.30/GJ. Suppliers contracted a total of 18 PJ of gas for 2026 supply, and 21 PJ for 2027.\nGas policy measures have not made a material difference for local users\nThe report also reviewed the impact of the Gas Market Code (Gas Code), the Commonwealth Heads of Agreement with LNG exporters (HoA) and the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM), following the ACCC’s initial observations reported in June 2025.\nThe ACCC has found these measures may have added some gas to the local market, but, overall, they have not materially improved outcomes for gas users.\n“There are limits to what the gas policy measures can achieve on their own if the underlying causes of inadequate supply and ineffective competition are not addressed,” Ms Brakey said.\n“In addition, they may also be having some unintended incentive effects and causing inefficiencies in gas supply negotiations.”\nThe ACCC’s review has found that the 2023 reforms to the ADGSM appear to have reduced LNG producers’ incentives to make a net contribution to the domestic market.\nThese changed incentives appear to have had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the risk of domestic supply shortfalls.\nFurther, since the 2022 HoA was entered into, the volumes of gas being offered and supplied by the LNG producers to the domestic market have declined over time, while LNG export volumes have increased.\nThe ACCC’s\nsubmission\nto the Gas Market Review outlines the ACCC’s experience and observations arising from the inquiry to inform government consideration of reforms to promote longer-term gas market efficiency and measures to ensure that, in the interim, the Code, ADGSM and HoA are fit for purpose.\nBackground\nIn 2017, the Australian Government directed the ACCC to conduct a\nwide-ranging inquiry\nto improve transparency of the gas market in Australia and support its efficient operation, and to monitor gas supply. On 29 August 2025 a\nnew direction\nwas made to formally extend the inquiry to 2030 and to establish quarterly reporting.\nThe ACCC’s next interim report is scheduled for December 2025\nRelease number\n110/25\nGeneral enquiries\nSubmit an online enquiry\nto ask a question or you can\nmake a report\nto help us understand where there are problems.\nMedia enquiries\nmedia@accc.gov.au or 1300 138 917.

Many of the consumers were First Nations Australians from regional, remote and very remote parts of Australia.</p>\n\n<p>“Optus’s conduct in this case was truly appalling, and we welcome the substantial penalty imposed by the Court and the deterrence message that it will send,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>“During the course of our investigation we heard from many people who had not only experienced significant financial harm, but also emotional distress and fear after being pursued by debt collectors for long periods.”</p>\n\n<p>“A company of Optus’s size should have had better systems and controls in place to identify and stop this sort of behaviour,” Ms Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>In his decision, Justice O’Sullivan said the consequences of Optus’s conduct were “profound”.</p>\n\n<p>“Numerous individuals experienced severe financial harm, emotional distress, and social shame,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“Particularly damaging was the heightened risk of losing access to essential telecommunications services when faced with inflated service costs.”</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the financial penalty, Optus has also provided the ACCC with a <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/undertakings-registers/optus-mobile-pty-ltd\">five-year court-enforceable undertaking</a> that it will compensate impacted consumers and improve its internal systems.</p>\n\n<p>Optus’s conduct impacted over 400 consumers and occurred at 16 Optus stores between August 2019 and July 2023. Any consumer who considers they may have been impacted by similar conduct should contact Optus.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of the misconduct included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>putting undue pressure on consumers to purchase a large number of products, including expensive phones and accessories, that they did not want or need, could not use or could not afford;</li>\n<li>failing to explain relevant terms and conditions to vulnerable consumers in a manner they could understand, resulting in them not understanding their ongoing payment obligations;</li>\n<li>not having regard to whether consumers had Optus coverage where they lived;</li>\n<li>selling products and services which Optus knew, or ought reasonably to have known, the consumers could not afford; and</li>\n<li>misleading these consumers to believe that goods were free or included as part of a bundle at no additional cost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Many impacted consumers were supported by local advocates, financial counsellors and carers in trying to seek a resolution with Optus. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“We commend the dedicated and hardworking people who assisted many of the affected consumers, and we also thank the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman for drawing the broader conduct to our attention,” Ms Lowe said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Optus’s Mount Isa store, which has now closed, the telco pursued debts in circumstances where its then senior management knew that those debts related to contracts for goods and services that appeared to have been entered into at the Optus Mount Isa Store fraudulently and without consumer knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Optus’s then senior management became increasingly aware that Optus staff were engaging in the inappropriate sales practices and that Optus’s systems and controls could not stop the conduct. Optus acknowledged it failed to promptly take steps to fix deficiencies in its systems, which allowed the conduct to continue.</p>\n\n<p>Commission-based sales arrangements for Optus’s sales staff had the clear potential to incentivise the inappropriate sales conduct, despite the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code requiring Optus, from 17 June 2022, to have regard to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/publications/consumer-vulnerability-a-business-guide-to-the-australian-consumer-law\">ACCC’s best practice recommendations</a> which recommend businesses avoid commission-based selling because of its potential to exacerbate the vulnerability of consumers.</p>\n\n<p>This case follows similar ACCC action against Telstra, which was ordered in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/telstra-to-pay-50m-penalty-for-unconscionable-sales-to-indigenous-consumers\">May 2021</a>&nbsp;to pay a $50 million penalty for engaging in unconscionable conduct when it sold mobile contracts to 108 First Nations Australians consumers between at least 1 January 2016 and about 27 August 2018.</p>\n\n<h2>Examples of the alleged conduct</h2>\n\n<p>A First Nations consumer visited an Optus store in a metro area. They were sold multiple Optus mobile plans and services, including two mobile phones, as well as accessories. The Optus sales representative manipulated the credit check, which enabled them to sell the consumer Optus services and products that they could not afford. Despite the details of the sale coming to the attention of Optus’s fraud team, the consumer’s debt in excess of $3,000 was referred to an external debt collection agency. The debt continued to be pursued by Optus for over a year.</p>\n\n<p>In a separate example, Optus entered into four contracts with a consumer who lived with deafness and communicated by Australian Sign Language. Optus staff failed to explain the terms of the consumer’s contract in a manner which they could understand. The consumer was on a disability pension, and the cost of the contracts was more than they could afford. In addition, the consumer did not need and could not use the Optus products and services. It was only with significant time and assistance of the consumer’s support worker that the consumer was able to cancel the contracts.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, an internal Optus investigation into customer accounts at the Optus store in Mount Isa resulted in a report that stated that the store manager had falsified identification documents and consumer information to create contracts for services, and had used the identities of First Nations consumers who were not aware that their identities had been used. Another report identified 82 contracts that appeared to have been fraudulently completed without consumer knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>After Optus was notified of the conduct that was the subject of the reports, including its senior management at the time, it still referred and sold outstanding debts associated with some of those contracts to third party debt collection and factoring agencies. Some consumers whose identities were associated with the relevant customer accounts were subject to threats of legal proceedings being commenced against them and of reporting defaults to credit reporting bodies. Some customers continued to be pursued by third party collections agencies until as late as July 2024 and Optus had not taken steps to stop that occurring.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC acknowledges Optus’s cooperation in resolving the Court proceedings at an early stage and providing a court-enforceable undertaking. The undertaking includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a 3-year consumer remediation program</li>\n<li>changes to remuneration and incentives for Optus sales staff designed to prevent further conduct from occurring</li>\n<li>a requirement for Optus to ensure that certain Optus Licensee stores in the Northern Territory, regional Queensland and South Australia are directly operated by Optus</li>\n<li>process and system changes, for example improvements to Optus’s complaints handling process for consumers experiencing vulnerability and/or disadvantage, and</li>\n<li>a $1 million donation to an organisation facilitating digital literacy of First Nations Australians. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Court also ordered Optus to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs, by consent.</p>\n\n<h2>Optus customer support</h2>\n\n<p>Consumers who think they may have been impacted by conduct similar to that <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/undertakings-registers/optus-mobile-pty-ltd\">outlined in Optus’s undertaking</a> to the ACCC can call Optus’s specialist customer care team on 1300 082 820 for further information or support.</p>\n\n<p>They can also visit the <a href=\"https://www.optus.com.au/support/sales-misconduct-update\">Sales Misconduct Response page</a> on Optus’s website.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p><em><strong>Questions regarding the recent Optus outage affecting triple-0 call services are unrelated to this judgment and should be directed to the <a href=\"https://www.acma.gov.au/acma-statement-optus-triple-zero-investigation\">Australian Communications and Media Authority</a> (ACMA).

    "full_text": "Media Release\n2025 Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivative Markets\nNumber\n2025-28\nDate\n1 October 2025\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has today released a summary of findings from the latest triennial survey of\nturnover in foreign exchange (FX) and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives markets that was\nconducted in the Australian market in April 2025. This was part of a global survey that involved central\nbanks and authorities from 52 jurisdictions and was coordinated by the Bank for International\nSettlements (BIS) to obtain comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of FX and\nOTC derivatives markets. Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986 for activity in\nFX markets and since 1995 for OTC interest rate derivatives markets.\nGlobally, the Australian dollar is the seventh most traded currency, down from sixth in the previous\nsurvey, and its share of turnover remained stable around 6 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the\nsixth most traded currency pair globally, accounting for around 5 per cent of all transactions.\nActivity in Australia’s FX market in April 2025 reached its highest level on record. The survey was\nconducted during a period of heightened FX volatility and a surge of trading activity following several\ntrade policy announcements by major economies. Average daily turnover in Australia’s FX market\nincreased by 34 per cent to US$201 billion per day in April 2025, from US$150 billion\nin April 2022.\n[1]\nAustralia’s FX market remains the the 11th largest in the world.\nIn the Australian FX market the majority of turnover remained in FX swaps, accounting for around\n53 per cent of total turnover. Spot transactions accounted for 25 per cent of\nAustralian turnover, up from 23 per cent in 2022, and outright forwards accounted for\n18 per cent of Australian turnover, little changed from the previous survey.\nActivity in the Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased sharply since the previous\nsurvey. Average daily turnover in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased by\n123 per cent to US$252 billion during April 2022, reflecting an increase in turnover of\ninterest rate swaps.\nThe preliminary results of the global turnover survey are available from the BIS website. The final data\nand related analysis will be released by the BIS in December 2025. Links to other participating\njurisdictions’ results are available from the BIS website. More detailed results for the Australian\nmarket are available on the\n2025 BIS Triennial Survey Results – Australia\npage. The BIS will also\npublish global data on amounts outstanding in OTC derivatives markets in November 2025.\nEndnote\nAustralian data are reported on a “net-gross” basis, correcting for local inter-dealer double counting\nonly.

    "full_text": "Media Release\nStatement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision\nNumber\n2025-27\nDate\n30 September 2025\nAt its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent.\nThe decline in underlying inflation has slowed.\nInflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to\nbring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. Both headline and trimmed mean\ninflation were within the\n2–3 per cent\nrange in the June quarter. Recent data, while partial\nand volatile, suggest that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of\nthe August\nStatement on Monetary Policy\n.\nDomestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain.\nData for the June quarter show that private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected,\ntaking over from public demand as the driver of growth. In particular, private consumption is picking up\nas real household incomes rise and measures of financial conditions ease. The housing market is\nstrengthening, a sign that recent interest rate decreases are having an effect. Credit is readily\navailable to both households and businesses.\nVarious indicators suggest that labour market conditions have been broadly steady in recent months and\nremain a little tight. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected, but the\nunemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 per cent in August. Measures of labour underutilisation\nremain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour has been little\nchanged of late. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but\nproductivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high.\nThere are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both\ndomestic and international developments. On the domestic side, stronger-than-expected data on growth and\ninflation may indicate that households have become more comfortable consuming as real incomes and wealth\nrise. If this continues, it may make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases and lead to more\ndemand for labour. Alternatively, the recent growth in consumption might not persist, particularly if\nhouseholds become more concerned about overseas developments.\nUncertainty in the global economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale\nof US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely\nto be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on\nglobal economic growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat\nto the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour\nmarket conditions in the domestic economy.\nThere are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing, the\nbalance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour\nmarket and the outlook for productivity.\nMaintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.\nWith signs that private demand is recovering, indications that inflation may be persistent in some areas\nand labour market conditions overall remaining stable, the Board decided that it was appropriate to\nmaintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the\nbeginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full\neffects of earlier cash rate reductions. The Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious,\nupdating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of\nuncertainty about the outlook.

    "full_text": "Media Release\nAssessment of ASX Clearing and Settlement Facilities – September 2025\nNumber\n2025-25\nDate\n24 September 2025\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia today released the\n2025\nAssessment of the ASX Clearing and Settlement (CS)\nFacilities\n. This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank’s Financial\nStability Standards (Standards).\nASX has considerable work to do to meet the Bank’s expectations for an operator of critical market\ninfrastructure. Recent shortcomings in risk management – particularly the December 2024 CHESS batch\nsettlement incident – have highlighted that ASX must make foundational changes to its governance,\nculture and risk management processes. ASX must also accelerate its uplift of operational and financial\nrisk management, while meeting key milestones for its major technology projects. Delivering on these\ninitiatives will require appropriate resourcing and the RBA will be closely monitoring progress over the\ncoming year.\nThe ASX CS facilities were rated as having ‘observed’ or ‘broadly observed’ many of\nthe individual Standards.\nThe Bank assessed that one or more of the CS facilities ‘partly observed’ requirements under the\nspecific Standards on the Framework for Comprehensive Management of Risks, Governance, Credit Risk,\nSettlement Finality, and Operational Risk. ASX Clear and ASX Settlement continue to be rated as ‘not\nobserved’ on the Operational Risk Standard, following the Bank’s\nout-of-cycle\nassessment\nagainst this Standard in March 2025.\nThe Bank has issued a number of recommendations, including that ASX should:\nobtain assurance that it has addressed gaps in its risk appetite statement and strategy to return to\nrisk appetite\nensure its risk transformation plan is appropriately resourced and implement regular reporting on the\nplan\nconduct a review of business continuity and contingency arrangement across the CS facilities\ncomprehensively improve data and reporting controls for financial risk models and address issues\nidentified in the assessment period.\nRBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said:\n‘ASX is not currently meeting\nthe regulators’ expectations for an operator of critical national infrastructure. Resilient and\nsecure CS facilities are crucial to the stability of the Australian financial system.\n‘This assessment highlights that ASX still has more work to do to in strengthening its governance, risk\nculture, and frameworks for managing operational and financial risk. We are expecting meaningful progress\nover the coming year and will consider further regulatory responses if necessary.’\nBackground\nThe Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on\nfinancial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed\non a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards determined by the Bank.\nThe Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX’s four CS facilities: two central counterparties –\nASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited – and two securities settlement\nfacilities – ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited. These assessments include a rating\nof the CS facilities’ observance against each financial stability standard.\nFor more information on the Bank’s approach to assessing CS facilities, see:\nThe\nReserve Bank’s Approach to Supervising and Assessing Clearing and Settlement Facility\nLicensees\n.\nASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the supervision of CS facilities. In carrying\nout supervision of CS facilities, the RBA works closely with ASIC.\nEnquiries\nCommunications Department\nReserve Bank of Australia\nSYDNEY\nPhone:\n+61 2 9551 8111\nEmail:\nrbainfo@rba.gov.au",

    "full_text": "Media Release\nPayments System Board Update: August 2025 Meeting\nNumber\n2025-23\nDate\n28 August 2025\nAt its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including:\nThe regulatory response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024.\nThe\nBoard reviewed ASX’s plans to ensure the current CHESS is adequately operated, maintained and\nsupported as a critical financial market infrastructure. Members noted that early progress is being\nmade and agreed that significant concerns remain. The Board also agreed on further regulatory steps to ensure CHESS\nReplacement is designed with an appropriate level of resilience for critical financial market\ninfrastructure.\nThe annual Assessment of the ASX clearing and settlement facilities against the Financial\nStability Standards\n. The Board endorsed the RBA’s Assessment, which will be\npublished after it has been provided to ASX, the Treasurer and the Australian Securities and\nInvestments Commission. Members observed that ASX has made limited progress in addressing the\nRBA’s fundamental concerns in relation to operational resilience and risk management over the\npast year. ASX’s response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024 and its aftermath\nhas also demonstrated that ASX must take urgent steps to improve its governance and risk culture. The\nsuccessful delivery of ASX’s current risk management, technology and transformation initiatives\nis crucial to the continuity of services that are critical to the stability of the Australian\nfinancial system.\nThe RBA’s oversight of international financial market infrastructures\n, including\nLCH SwapClear, CME, Clearstream Banking, Euroclear Bank, CLS and Swift. Many of these infrastructures\nare engaged in complex, multi-year transformation programs to modernise systems and enhance\nresilience. Members emphasised the importance of strong project governance, testing and migration\nstrategies to support the ongoing safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. Members also\ndiscussed the risks associated with growing reliance by financial market infrastructures on a small\nnumber of critical third-party service providers. The Board welcomed ASIC’s decision to grant\nClearstream Banking a clearing and settlement facility licence. Members highlighted the importance of\nthe RBA and ASIC, as co-regulators of clearing and settlement facilities operating in Australia,\nhaving sufficient oversight of such facilities.\nThe system-wide resilience of the Australian payments system.\nThe Board highlighted\nthe growing importance of operational resilience in the context of a more complex and challenging\nenvironment for operational risk in the payments system. Regulators and entities will need to increase their\nfocus on system-wide interdependencies. The Board endorsed an ongoing research program examining\ninteroperability, third-party and concentration risks, resilience arrangements for high-value\npayments and the vulnerability of the payments system to utilities outages.\nThe future of cash distribution arrangements.\nMembers discussed the challenges in\nthe cash distribution system. There is an ongoing need for industry cooperation to work towards a more\ndurable future distribution system that supports the availability of cash in the community, including in\nrural and regional Australia. Cash remains an important means of payment for many Australians and can\nplay a valuable role as a back-up to electronic payments, as part of a resilient and inclusive\npayments ecosystem. Members noted that a new proposed regulatory framework for providers of cash\ndistribution services, which was the subject of a recent CFR and ACCC consultation, should contribute\nto the management of risks relating to the continuity of cash distribution services across Australia.\nReview of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging.\nThe Board was provided with an\nupdate on the initial responses of stakeholders to the Consultation Paper published in July. Members\nnoted feedback regarding the potential impact of the proposed card payments regulations on the\nability of small issuers and fintechs to compete and innovate. Members held a preliminary discussion\non whether there is a case to reduce the regulatory burden of card payments regulations on small\nissuers and what options might best support this objective. The issue will be considered further as\npart of the consultation process for the Review.\nGlobal developments in stablecoins.\nMembers discussed the recent sharp growth in\nthe global stablecoin market, noting the market is largely concentrated in a small number of\nUS dollar stablecoins. Members discussed the expansion in potential use cases for stablecoins,\nincluding as a means of payment and in cross-border transactions. They also considered the emerging\nregulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. While the stablecoin market in Australia is currently\nvery small, members discussed a range of potential domestic implications if the use of stablecoins\nwere to grow considerably. The Board also welcomed the Government’s proposed reforms aimed at\nensuring that stored-value facilities, including stablecoins, operate under a strong regulatory and\nlicencing regime.\nEnquiries\nCommunications Department\nReserve Bank of Australia\nSYDNEY\nPhone:\n+61 2 9551 8111\nEmail:\nrbainfo@rba.gov.au",

    "full_text": "More on the August 2025 monetary policy decision\nMedia Release\nStatement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision\nNumber\n2025-22\nDate\n12 August 2025\nAt its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to\n3.60 per cent.\nInflation has continued to moderate.\nInflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to\nbring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. In the June quarter, trimmed mean\ninflation over the year fell to 2.7 per cent, broadly as expected in May. Headline inflation,\nwhich has partly been affected by temporary cost of living relief measures, was 2.1 per cent,\nalso as forecast. Updated staff forecasts for the August meeting suggest that underlying inflation will\ncontinue to moderate to around the midpoint of the\n2–3 per cent\nrange, with the cash rate assumed to follow a\ngradual easing path.\nThe outlook remains uncertain.\nUncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale\nof US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely\nto be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on\nglobal economic activity, and there remains a risk that households and firms delay expenditure pending\nstill greater clarity on the outlook. As in May, the forecasts assume that both effects weigh on activity\nand inflation in Australia for a period.\nDomestically, private demand appears to have been recovering gradually, real household incomes have picked\nup and some measures of financial conditions have eased.\nVarious indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, although have eased\nfurther in recent months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in the month of June and\naveraged 4.2 per cent in the June quarter as a whole, in line with the May forecasts. Measures\nof labour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that\navailability of labour is still a constraint for a range of employers. Looking through quarterly\nvolatility, wages growth has eased from its peak but productivity growth has not picked up and growth in\nunit labour costs remains high.\nThere are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both\ndomestic and international developments. The forecasts released today are for the recovery in household\nconsumption growth to be sustained as real incomes rise. Businesses in some sectors, however, continue to\nreport that weakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases to final prices. There is\na risk that consumption growth is a little slower than expected, which could weigh on growth in aggregate\ndemand and lead to weaker labour market conditions. Alternatively, as real incomes and wealth continue to\nrise, households might choose to consume more and save less than expected. Labour market outcomes may\nalso prove stronger than expected, given the signal from a range of leading indicators.\nThere are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how\nfirms’ pricing decisions and wages will respond to the balance between aggregate demand and\npotential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and continued weak productivity\noutcomes.\nMaintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.\nWith underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the\n2–3 per cent\nrange and labour market conditions easing\nslightly, as expected, the Board judged that a further easing of monetary policy was appropriate. This\ntakes the decline in the cash rate since the beginning of the year to 75 basis points. The Board\nnevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty\nabout both aggregate demand and potential supply. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond\ndecisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and\ninflation in Australia.\nThe Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions. In\ndoing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends\nin domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.

    "full_text": "More on the November 2025 monetary policy decision\nMedia Release\nStatement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision\nNumber\n2025-31\nDate\n4 November 2025\nAt its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent.\nInflation has recently picked up.\nInflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to\nbring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. More recently, however, inflation has\npicked up. Trimmed mean inflation was 1.0 per cent in the September quarter and\n3.0 per cent over the year, up from 2.7 per cent over the year in the June quarter.\nThis was materially higher than expected at the time of the August\nStatement on Monetary\nPolicy\n. Headline inflation rose sharply to 3.2 per cent over the year in the\nSeptember quarter, a large part of which was expected given the cessation of electricity rebates in a\nnumber of states.\nThe Board’s judgement is that some of the increase in underlying inflation in the September quarter\nwas due to temporary factors. The central forecast in the November\nStatement on Monetary\nPolicy\n, which is based on a technical assumption of one more rate cut in 2026, has underlying\ninflation rising above 3 per cent in coming quarters before settling at 2.6 per cent\nin 2027.\nDomestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain.\nData on consumption suggest that the pick-up in private demand evident in the June quarter is ongoing. The\nhousing market is continuing to strengthen, a sign that recent interest rate reductions are having an\neffect. Housing prices are rising and dwelling construction costs have also started to increase again\nafter a period of weak growth. Credit is readily available to both households and businesses.\nVarious indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, notwithstanding a recent\neasing. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected and the unemployment rate rose to\n4.5 per cent in September from 4.3 per cent in August. But measures of labour\nunderutilisation remain at low rates, job vacancies are still at a high level and business surveys and\nliaison continue to suggest that a significant share of firms are experiencing difficulty sourcing\nlabour. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but productivity\ngrowth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high.\nThere are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both\ndomestic and international developments. On the domestic side, if the pick-up in private demand continues\nto exceed expectations, this could increase the demand for labour, add to capacity pressures and make it\neasier for businesses to pass on cost increases. Alternatively, the improvement in private demand might\nnot persist.\nUncertainty in the global economy remains elevated but so far there has been minimal impact on overall\ngrowth and trade, and many forecasters have revised up their near-term expectations for world growth.\nTrade policy developments are still expected to have an adverse effect on world growth over time. Beyond\ntariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat to the global economy. This could all\nweigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions in the domestic economy.\nThere are also uncertainties regarding the assessment that monetary policy remains a little restrictive,\nthe lags in the effect of recent monetary easing, the balance between aggregate demand and potential\nsupply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and the outlook for productivity growth.\nThese uncertainties present risks in both directions to the inflation and employment outlook.\nMaintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.\nThe recent data on inflation suggest that some inflationary pressure may remain in the economy. With\nprivate demand recovering and labour market conditions still appearing a little tight, the Board decided\nthat it was appropriate to maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial\nconditions have eased since the beginning of the year, but it will take some time to see the full effects\nof earlier cash rate reductions. Given this, and the recent evidence of more persistent inflation, the\nBoard judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, updating its view of the outlook as the data\nevolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of uncertainty about the outlook in both\ndirections.\nThe Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its\ndecisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial\nmarkets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is\nfocused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers\nnecessary to achieve that outcome.\nDecision\nToday’s policy decision was unanimous.\nMore on the November 2025 monetary policy decision...\nStatement on Monetary Policy\nThe RBA's assessment of the economy that the Board considered in making its decision.\nStatement on Monetary Policy\nEnquiries\nCommunications Department\nReserve Bank of Australia\nSYDNEY\nPhone:\n+61 2 9551 8111\nEmail:\nrbainfo@rba.gov.au",
