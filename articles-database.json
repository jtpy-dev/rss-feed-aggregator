    "full_text": "Media Releases\nAPRA revises governance proposals following industry consultation\nFriday 24 October 2025\nPrint\nEmail\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has provided an update on its consultation to modernise the prudential framework on governance for banks, insurers and superannuation trustees.\nIn March,\nAPRA proposed eight measures\nto update its cross-industry prudential standards and guidance on governance for the first time in more than a decade.\nDuring the three-month consultation period, APRA held 57 meetings and roundtables involving over 150 stakeholder organisations and received almost 80 written submissions. Through these engagements, APRA received broad support for the package overall, especially for initiatives that can reduce burden and address regulatory overlap. But APRA also heard caution around the potential impact of some proposals.\nHaving carefully considered this feedback, APRA has today written to industry advising it will modify three of its original proposals to ensure they don’t impose undue regulatory constraint on boards:\nInstead of a tenure limit for non-executive directors of 10 years with the possibility of a two-year extension, APRA now proposes a hard tenure limit of 12 years with short extensions in limited circumstances.\nA proposal for banks and insurers to have at least two independent directors (including the chair) not on other group boards will not proceed as originally proposed.\nA proposal to require significant financial institutions to engage early with APRA on responsible person appointments and succession planning will also not proceed.\nAPRA will also clarify or adjust proposals relating to individual director skills, perceived conflicts of interest, and publication of registers of relevant interests and duties.\nChair John Lonsdale said APRA remains committed to uplifting standards of governance in banking, insurance and superannuation.\n“Effective governance is fundamental to financial stability and sound risk management. Across our regulated industries, APRA continues to see cases where deficient governance leads to poor prudential outcomes.\n“However, in strengthening standards of governance, we want to strike a balance between increased prescription in some areas and making sure we retain sufficient flexibility for different business models.\n“We have benefited from the range of feedback from consultation, and today’s update demonstrates that we have listened carefully to the views of stakeholders. These changes will still deliver the uplift in governance standards APRA is seeking but we have found an outcome that works better for all parties.\n“APRA will continue to engage with industry as we work towards releasing updated prudential standards and guidance for further consultation in the first half of next year.”\nToday’s letter is available on the APRA website at:\nGovernance review update\n.\nMedia enquiries\nContact APRA Media Unit, on\n+61 2 9210 3636\nAll other enquiries\nFor more information contact APRA on\n1300 558 849\n.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry. It oversees banks, mutuals, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, private health insurers, friendly societies, and most members of the superannuation industry. APRA currently supervises institutions holding around $9 trillion in assets for Australian depositors, policyholders and superannuation fund members.",

However, accreditation to use the IRB approach requires banks to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in their risk management practices that has historically been too resource-intensive for most banks to achieve.\nNoting that some medium-sized banks have expressed interest in obtaining IRB accreditation, APRA is seeking to make the pathway to IRB accreditation more accessible for these banks. This was one of the commitments APRA made as part of the recent\nCouncil of Financial Regulators’ and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Review into Small and Medium-sized Banks\n.\nIn a consultation paper released today, APRA has proposed a range of changes to the IRB accreditation pathway designed to help more banks access the IRB approach.\nAPRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said the proposed changes are further evidence of APRA’s commitment to “getting the balance right” in its regulatory settings.\n“Capital is the cornerstone of every bank’s financial resilience so it’s essential banks can accurately align their capital requirements with the risks they face.\n“For most banks, the simpler and more conservative standardised approach to calculating risk weighted assets is the most cost-effective way for them to do this. But we recognise that a cohort of mid-sized banks have told us that gaining IRB accreditation would help them compete more effectively with the largest banks, especially for home loans.\n“While we don’t intend to drop our standards, the changes we are proposing today would improve the flexibility and transparency of the accreditation process, thereby supporting banks to more confidently plan, invest and transition, should they wish to,” Ms McCarthy Hockey said.\nA consultation paper outlining the proposed changes is available here:\nA new pathway to internal ratings-based accreditation\n.\nFootnotes\n1\nMore information on the two approaches to calculating risk-weighted assets is available here:\nAPRA Explains: Risk-weighted assets | APRA\n2\nBanks accredited to use the IRB approach are the four major banks, Macquarie Bank and ING Bank Australia.\nMedia enquiries\nContact APRA Media Unit, on\n+61 2 9210 3636\nAll other enquiries\nFor more information contact APRA on\n1300 558 849\n.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry.

    "full_text": "Speeches\nDeputy Chair Margaret Cole - Remarks to the FSC Innovation in Retirement conference\nThursday 16 October 2025\nPrint\nEmail\nIt’s a pleasure to be here and to have this opportunity to discuss APRA’s priorities for superannuation as the industry transitions to the retirement phase.\nThis is one of my first public speaking engagements since the announcement of my decision to leave APRA by the end of my term in June next year. It has been, and continues to be, a privilege to oversee the industry at such a critical stage of its history.\nThe superannuation industry is in a state of change driven by three powerful forces.\nThe first, and the basis of many discussions at this forum today, is the ageing of the population and the implications that has for trustees and their members.\nTreasury has previously estimated that around 2.5 million Australians will transition from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase in this decade.\nHow trustees respond to the challenge of supporting a sharply higher number of members in retirement will be a true test of the system.\nThe second is the continued strong growth in superannuation assets. The system now has $4.3 trillion in assets, of which $3 trillion are held in APRA-regulated funds.\nThat makes it the fourth largest pension system in the world behind that of the US, Canada and the UK, and, by some estimates, is on track to become the second largest by 2040. The expanding asset pool adds complexity for trustees in how they manage, invest, spend and safeguard their members’ monies.\nThe third force is superannuation’s increasing significance to the broader financial system. The potential risks to financial stability arising from the increased interconnectedness of banking and superannuation are important to understand. We expect to publish the early findings from APRA’s inaugural system stress test, which evaluated those risks, later this year.\nWhen you factor in geopolitical instability, the rise in cyberattacks and fraud, as well as the growth in artificial intelligence, trustees have an extremely complex and fast-evolving operating environment to navigate.\nBefore I delve into the detail of APRA’s priorities for super, it’s worth reflecting: where did this large complex system, which has become so important to the financial wellbeing of Australians in retirement, first begin?\nThe introduction of the superannuation guarantee in 1992 was critical to the creation and rapid expansion of the universal compulsory superannuation system that we have today. However, the first employer-funded pension scheme came into being a full century and a half earlier.\nIn 1842 the local directors of the fledging Australasian Bank wanted to find a way to retain their bank officers. So, they came up with the idea – and their UK-based proprietors agreed – to launch a bank-funded pension scheme.\nThe scheme was formally approved at an annual meeting held in London in June of that year, with the first report of the meeting hitting the headlines of the Sydney Morning Herald\n1\nsome four months later, such being the pace of international news at the time.\nTo quote from the Herald article dated 8th of October 1842:\n“It appeared to the directors that the most effectual way of retaining the services of their officers would be to create a fund out of which pensions should be granted to those who, from age or length of meritorious service, or physical incapacity, might establish a claim to such a provision.”\nBut it is what follows that I found of particular interest. The meeting report goes on to say – and, again, I quote:\n“It will be some years before a claim can arise to form a charge on this fund, and when that period approaches the directors will be prepared with a digested plan for its application.”\nIn case of doubt let me assure you such a “we’ll worry about it later” approach would not hold much water with APRA today.\nNor would it align with the spirit of the Retirement Income Covenant, which is central to one of APRA’s core strategic objectives: improved outcomes for superannuation members.\nThe Retirement Income Covenant – a case for urgency\nThe introduction of the Retirement Income Covenant more than three years ago represented a major nudge for the super industry.\nWhile the accumulation phase of superannuation continued to require trustees’ strong focus, it was critical that the industry should pay greater attention to supporting the needs of members in or approaching retirement.\nA core obligation under the covenant is for trustees to develop and implement retirement income strategies. But a year after the covenant came into effect, an APRA and ASIC joint thematic review identified a lack of urgency by trustees to meet their obligations.\nWhile we have seen progress and improvements since then, there is a clear and growing gap between trustees who are meeting baseline expectations and those who have embraced retirement as a strategic and competitive imperative.\nThe case for having robust retirement income strategies is pressing. Our data shows that one in five funds have more than half of their members in or approaching retirement. However, over the next 20 years, this is expected to rise to around two in five funds.\nThe initial thematic review was followed by an APRA-ASIC pulse check survey last year, which explored the progress trustees were making to implement the recommendations arising from the review.\nYet again, we were concerned to find a lack of progress, this time in the tracking and measuring the success of retirement income strategies, despite this being a core recommendation.\nOur latest joint pulse check was conducted earlier this year. How much progress has been made, and where there is still room for improvement, will be outlined in the survey findings, due for release next month.\nMeeting members needs\nUnderstanding the needs of members, and tailoring support to help them balance the objectives of maximising income, managing risks, and flexible access, lies at the heart of the covenant. This includes providing access to quality information to support member decision-making at the point of retirement.\nWhile some funds are doing a good job at this, we believe there are still many members who could benefit from greater access to easy-to-understand information about the products, services and choices available to them.\nOur data suggests that large numbers of retirement-age members remain in accumulation phase products paying tax where, depending on their personal circumstances, they are likely to be better off in the tax-free retirement phase. For example, $99 billion of assets in MySuper accounts are held in the accounts of members aged 65 or over.\nIn terms of products, APRA is doing its part to support greater product innovation in meeting the specific and various needs of members.\nAPRA recently consulted with the life insurance industry on proposals to reduce capital requirements for insurers offering annuity products. APRA’s aim is to lower the cost to life insurers of providing annuity products, helping to attract participants and support growth in the market, so that more members can consider this type of product where suitable for their individual circumstances. APRA will commence a second consultation on these reforms shortly and aims to finalise the proposed changes in the first half of next year.\nThe bigger picture\nThe oncoming wave of members entering retirement will bring a substantial increase in assets in the retirement phase of super. Our latest estimates are that assets in retirement products will swell from $575 billion to around $3 trillion in 20 years’ time.\nTrustees will need to be prepared to manage the significant risk that this represents: Cyber risk, operational risk, investment risk, liquidity risk immediately spring to mind.\nThe credential stuffing cyberattacks that targeted individual superannuation members at several different funds earlier year were contained. But their occurrence exposed persistent weaknesses in authentication practices across the industry. They also indicated that the super system was in the sights of threat actors.\nUnlike members in the accumulation phase, those in retirement can access their super savings which increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks, scams and fraud. A continuing priority for APRA is to ensure that regulated entities have robust information controls in place, including – but not limited to - multi factor authentication for member accounts.\nFor me, the urgency for planning and action on cyber protections was further emphasised this week by the Australian Signals Directorate. As reported in the media, the directorate has warned that developments in quantum computing could break the encryption used to protect passwords within five years. It’s a sobering thought.\nGiven the growing reliance on third parties, rapid technological advancements and geopolitical uncertainty, effective implementation of APRA’s operational risk management standard CPS 230 – particularly those requirements relating to oversight of material service providers – is critical to maintaining financial safety and stability. We will continue to engage with trustees to ensure they are meeting their new obligations.\nWith more assets to invest, trustees are increasingly looking to overseas investment options as well as private unlisted assets to drive returns for members. Increased overseas deployment heightens, among other things, currency risk and increased investment in unlisted assets raises questions about the management of liquidity risk and fair valuation.\nTransparency\nGreater industry transparency will further improve outcomes for members. APRA is committed to increasing transparency of retirement product performance and the industry’s progress in implementing the Retirement Income Covenant.\nWe now publish fund-level data on retirement product investment returns and investment strategies. APRA will integrate this data into our Comprehensive Product Performance Package from the second half of 2025-26. This will provide a more comprehensive view of product performance across the superannuation sector.\nAPRA is also working with Treasury to design a new reporting framework on retirement outcomes, which will commence in 2027. This initiative will enable monitoring of the outcomes delivered to members in retirement in a consistent and transparent way. The next step with the Retirement Reporting Framework is for Government to confirm the scope of the framework, following the consultation undertaken by Treasury earlier this year.\nGetting the balance right\nAvid readers of APRA’s Corporate Plan\n2\nwill be aware that we added a new strategic objective this year – Getting the Balance Right.\nThis is about our need to balance our financial safety and stability objectives with competition and efficiency considerations.\nUnder that objective we are progressing nine actions to minimise regulatory burden.\nIn addition to the reduction of capital requirements for annuity products which I mentioned earlier, the initiatives include introducing further proportionality, removing unnecessary or duplicative rules, and strengthening data sharing with other agencies.\nThe world is watching\nThe push to improve financial outcomes for fund members in retirement is not unique to Australia.\nMany jurisdictions around the world are focused on retirement funding for their own ageing populations.\nBut what does set our system apart from many others is the maturity of our compulsory defined contribution system which supports a constant flow of new capital into the superannuation system.\nThe UK, which has previously relied to a greater extent in recent years on a defined benefit system, is transitioning towards a defined contributions model. The development of the UK’s Value for Money framework for defined contribution pension funds, has taken into account Australia’s approach and experience.\nThe strong interest in our system was also evident in my recent meetings with UK pension authorities and regulators and at last month’s International Organisation of Pension Regulators sessions.\nConclusion\nIn closing, Australia’s superannuation system is, in many respects, the envy of the world.\nBut we know it’s not perfect.\nIt introduces complexity at a time in members’ lives when they don’t want complexity.\nTo keep superannuation a world class system, trustees need to respond to the challenges arising from the three powerful drivers of change that are shaping the industry.\nThat means doing more to improve outcomes for members in retirement.\nDoing more to build operational resilience as the system continues to expand.\nAnd doing more to understand the systemic significance of superannuation, not just at a fund level, but in the context of the broader financial system.\nTrustees must be equipped and capable to meet the challenges – both risks and opportunities lie ahead.\nThank you\nFootnotes\n1.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald Sat 8 October 1842\n08 Oct 1842 - Trove\n2.\nAPRA Corporate Plan 2025-26 | APRA\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry.

As the national data collection agency for the financial sector, APRA collects points of presence information from ADIs and publishes it annually.\nThe latest statistics show the ongoing trend of a decline in physical points of presence over the last year, albeit at a slower rate than previous years. The number of bank branches nationwide fell 4.6 per cent between June 2024 and June 2025. Regional and remote areas experienced the smallest fall recorded since this data series began (1.9 per cent), due in part to a moratorium on regional branch closures agreed between the Government and major banks in February this year.\nThese statistics do not cover the entirety of banking service channels. Trends in physical banking service channels provided by ADIs should be considered in the broader context of increased usage of digital banking services and the presence of other service providers. APRA encourages industry bodies to work together to provide increased transparency on this matter. For example, as the industry association for the payments system, the Australian Payments Network publishes data on ATMs, including those operated by third parties.\nAPRA has also concluded its review of Points of Presence data for ADIs.

    "full_text": "Speeches\nAPRA Executive Board Member Suzanne Smith - Remarks to the ICA conference 2025\nFriday 10 October 2025\nPrint\nEmail\nFrom risk to resilience: Futureproofing Australia’s insurance sector\nIntroduction\nGood morning and thank you for the invitation. It's a pleasure to return to the ICA conference for my third address.\nI’m pleased to be here with my ASIC colleague, Commissioner Alan Kirkland.\nThe theme of futureproofing Australia in a risky world is highly relevant. Who better to manage the challenges of a risky and ever-evolving world than those who live and breathe risk every day? Insurers.\nRisks are on the rise, with businesses facing geopolitical instability, cyber threats and a changing climate. Despite these evolving challenges, communities continue to expect that insurers get the basics right. Each claim filed tests how well those expectations are met. Enhancing consumer understanding of policies is vital, or diminishing trust could undermine the social licence of insurers.\nSo, it is important that you take the time to ask yourself what is within your control to ensure that those expectations are met, and how you will hold yourself and others accountable to deliver on those promises?\nThe conference themes of resilience, innovation and leadership are a great starting point to challenge yourselves on how you do that. Today, I will have a look at each of these three industry pillars.\nResilience: get the basics right, every day\nLet’s start with resilience. It’s the heartbeat of insurance – helping communities recover from disastrous events, giving investors confidence and boosting communities’ financial and social resilience.\nWe acknowledge there are many factors that sit outside of the control of insurers alone. Climate change, the need for de-risking, mitigation and addressing cost-of-living pressures rely on a suite of actors including government, the community and other businesses to effect change.\nHowever, you are in control when it comes to how you run your business, manage your risks, treat your customers, innovate your products and, ultimately, build trust and resilience in your industry.  In the past year, the industry has taken positive steps to strengthen resilience through better disaster planning, and commencing work on implementing commitments made in the Industry Action Plan in response to the 2022 Flood Inquiry.\nWhile this work is strengthening the core of your business, note resilience isn’t a ”one and done” exercise, it’s a constant practice of adaptation.\nAnd true resilience rests on solid fundamentals, including, but not limited to:\na strong capital base that’s supported by prudent underwriting and effective risk management;\noperational resilience, including third-party oversight and planning for major risk events;\nrobust and sound claims management capabilities, processes and controls; and\ncyber security that keeps pace with evolving threats.\nGetting the basics right is non-negotiable. APRA will continue to push you in these areas, but we hope to see insurers proactively holding themselves accountable to ensure their basics are strong.\nThe implementation of the Financial Accountability Regime in March this year has further increased accountability. Under FAR, insurers must have appointed accountable persons to take responsibility for key insurance functions in areas including capital management, risk management, underwriting, reinsurance and product design.\nEmbracing innovation\nLet’s look at innovation: It isn’t optional – it’s essential. It’s how we futureproof insurance and support a thriving, competitive industry. By embracing effective design and implementation, innovation can improve customer engagement at various touchpoints, while also delivering cost efficiencies that can assist with affordability pressures. Innovations can also make it easier to identify and respond to risks.\nThe risks we face today – cyber, climate, geopolitical – demand smarter and faster responses. Investment in digital capabilities, AI, and new business strategies will open new opportunities and enhance industry resilience.\nAI shows considerable potential in areas such as underwriting, claims processes, cybersecurity, fraud detection, and crisis prevention. It can bring efficiency to your business and in turn deliver greater value to your customers. However, it’s imperative that you fully understand the risks, as well as the opportunities.\nWhile I encourage you to embrace innovation, I have one reminder: solve for the customer – and do this transparently.  What more can you do to help your customer understand why their premium has changed, the factors that contribute to an increasing price and importantly what role, if any they can play to bring the cost down? Transparency builds trust – and trust builds your business.\nLeadership: step up – together\nThat brings us to leadership. In a risky world, leadership means courage and clarity.\nGood leadership creates resilience. It shapes a strong risk culture.\nAPRA’s latest “Insurance Sector Risk Culture Survey” shows what \"good\" practice looks like:\nBoards that drive real change, executives who challenge constructively and staff who feel safe to speak up.\nClear roles and accountability, including proper recognition and support for risk raisers.\nAnd a risk culture that’s embraced across the organisation. From leaders to middle managers, and from back office to frontline teams.\nThis survey also unearthed pain points for claims and technology staff – areas that need urgent uplift.\nThe insights from this survey will help you to understand your business and step ahead of your risks. Insurers who address these issues promptly can significantly enhance their competitive position.\nAPRA: getting the balance right\nAccountability is not just something APRA expects from the entities we regulate. It is something we constantly challenge ourselves on. We publicly outline our strategic priorities each year in our Corporate Plan – most recently in August.\nIn addition to strengthening our focus on aspects like cyber and operational resilience, the latest plan sharpens APRA’s focus on “getting the balance right”. This means promoting system safety and stability in a balanced and efficient way.\nAPRA is progressing a range of initiatives to minimise regulatory burden for the industry to support productivity. While we have a prudential framework in place that is designed to minimise unnecessary burden, we will further promote efficiency, transparency, and proportional regulation where it’s safe to do so. For the general insurance sector, areas of focus include:\nthe adjustments of reinsurance settings to promote cost-effective access;\nthe ongoing review of data collections; and\nthe identification of data sharing opportunities with other government agencies to minimise complexity and duplication.\nOver the coming months, APRA will engage with industry stakeholders to gather feedback on how to strike the optimal regulatory balance.\nSharing examples of duplicative or overly complex requirements will help us improve. I look forward to your insights.\nInto the future\nFutureproofing fundamentally means anticipating challenges and identifying strategies to mitigate shocks. While APRA does not expect the industry to foresee every possible emerging risk, public expectations for fair treatment remain constant. And, regardless of external difficulties, the requirement that insurers get the basics right will not abate.\nMoreover, maintaining a social licence to operate relies on insurers’ accountability in making decisions that foster trust within the sector.\nIf you master the basics, embrace innovation, and lead with a strong risk culture, you won’t just weather the next storm - you’ll strengthen trust in an industry that is essential to the community and our economy.\nYes, the future is risky. But it’s also full of opportunity. Let’s make sure Australia is prepared.\nThank you.

    "full_text": "Opening statements\nOpening Statement to Senate Economics Legislation Committee – October 2025\nThursday 9 October 2025\nPrint\nEmail\nJohn Lonsdale, Chair - Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\nThank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.\nI’d like to begin by acknowledging the new members of this Committee, particularly Chair Senator Darmanin and Deputy Chair Senator Hume. APRA looks forward to continuing to work with the Committee throughout this Parliamentary term.\nI’m pleased to confirm to the committee that Australia has a stable and safe financial system, benefiting from prudential regulation and policy settings reviewed and enhanced over many years. The importance of a stable financial system cannot be underestimated at a time of such global uncertainty.\nAppearances before parliamentary committees such as this are one of the key mechanisms through which APRA remains accountable to the parliament and the Australian people. Another is our Annual Report, which we tabled to parliament last week.\nOur 2024-25\nAnnual Report\ndetails how APRA continues to deliver on its core purpose of maintaining the resilience and stability of banks, insurers and superannuation trustees. The past 12 months have been marked by ongoing geopolitical volatility and cyber threats. Despite these challenges, APRA’s Annual Report confirms that our banks have “unquestionably strong” levels of capital to protect deposits and support lending; insurers retain the financial strength to pay claims from policyholders; and the superannuation industry continues to deliver robust returns for members, while also making headway in improving retirement outcomes.\nAPRA’s forward-looking roadmap for fulfilling our mandate is outlined in our\nCorporate Plan\n, published in August, which outlines our policy, supervision, resolution and data priorities.\nAs always, our latest plan has a strong focus on maintaining the financial and operational resilience of the financial system and responding to significant and emerging risks.\nThis year our Corporate Plan elevates “getting the balance right” as a strategic priority. While APRA’s prudential framework has always been proportionate, as required by our mandate, we are sharpening our focus to ensure our regulation remains right-sized and efficient – and therefore supportive of competition and productivity in the economy.\nSo far, APRA has announced nine initiatives to increase proportionality and reduce regulatory burden. In banking, these include streamlining our bank licensing process and formalising a three-tiered approach to proportionality. Other commitments include promoting access to cost-effective reinsurance in general insurance, reducing life insurers’ capital requirements for annuities, and removing duplicative or unnecessary requirements, especially in data reporting.\nOur Corporate Plan also outlines how we are intensifying scrutiny of superannuation fund expenditure and reviewing the investment governance of major platform providers.\nTo that end, APRA wrote to trustees this week requiring them to accelerate and escalate efforts to safeguard member investments held in platform products after an APRA review found some weak practices in relation to onboarding and monitoring of platform products. Based on the findings of this review, APRA will provide each in-scope Platform Trustee with an individual assessment letter bilaterally and escalate supervisory intensity as required.\nWe have also published insights into the challenges facing some superannuation trustees in operational efficiency, growth and competitive positioning and emphasised to Trustees the importance of considering these challenges as part of their strategic and business planning.\nAnother top priority in the months ahead is finalising reforms to our cross-industry framework for governance. This is a significant piece of work; well-governed institutions are likely to be more resilient in times of stress, while poor governance can create weakness that leads to misconduct, losses and failures. We have had more submissions to this consultation than any other in recent memory. We will provide an interim update on the consultation shortly.\nIn July, we announced we were keeping our macroprudential policy settings, including the mortgage serviceability buffer, on hold. Housing credit continues to grow at sound levels and continue to flow to different borrower segments, including to first-home buyers. Even though inflation and interest rates are lower, we are mindful of ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Further, lower interest rates have historically led to higher credit growth and leverage, higher house prices and often more risky lending. As a result, we are engaging with banks on implementation aspects of different macroprudential tools to manage lending risks, which may include limits on new high debt-to-income lending, or limits on new investor or interest-only loans.\nWe also intend to further strengthen cyber resilience across all APRA’s regulated industries given the recent escalation of attacks. We were reminded of this threat earlier this year when several major superannuation funds were the target of credential stuffing attacks.\nClosely related to cyber security is operational resilience. In July, APRA’s new prudential standard on operational risk management, CPS 230, came into effect. This standard is aimed at ensuring banks, insurers and superannuation trustees can respond to business disruptions that may impact their delivery of essential financial services to the community, particularly in relation to their use of service providers.\nAnother key initiative will be the publication in coming months of the results of our inaugural System Stress Test, designed to evaluate interconnectedness between the banking and superannuation sectors.\nBefore wrapping up, I would like to acknowledge the recent announcement of APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole’s decision to leave APRA by the end of her current term next year. Margaret has made a great contribution to APRA since joining us in 2021. Margaret has strengthened our legal and enforcement functions and helped reshape processes to make APRA a more efficient regulator.\nWith that, my APRA colleagues are happy to take your questions.\nMedia enquiries\nContact APRA Media Unit, on\n+61 2 9210 3636\nAll other enquiries\nFor more information contact APRA on\n1300 558 849\n.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry.

    "full_text": "Media Releases\nAPRA disqualifies two directors of Xinja Bank under Financial Accountability Regime\nThursday 9 October 2025\nPrint\nEmail\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has disqualified the former CEO of Xinja Bank (Xinja) and one other director from being or acting as accountable persons of any authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI)\n1\nunder the Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) for failing to comply with their accountability obligations.\nFormer CEO Eric Wilson has been disqualified for a period of eight years, while non-executive director Craig Swanger has been disqualified for 10 years. They are the first disqualifications under the FAR.\nXinja, now known as A.C.N. 618 937 054 Limited, is in liquidation after\nreturning deposits\nand handing back its ADI licence to APRA in 2021.\nThe disqualifications follow an extensive investigation by APRA into the impact that “side agreements” between Xinja and some of its investors had on Xinja’s capital position during 2020 and whether APRA was misled in relation to the bank’s capital position. APRA’s investigation commenced in May 2021 and the disqualifications have been subject to review processes.\nBetween May and August 2020, Xinja entered into agreements with three investors purporting to raise CET1 capital. CET1 capital is considered the highest quality of capital because it does not result in any repayment or distribution obligations on an institution. Xinja represented to APRA that this capital was CET1 capital. However, the transactions involved Xinja entering into side agreements together with share subscription agreements with the investors. The side agreements contained additional terms that undermined the investments’ status as CET1 capital, in turn undermining APRA’s capital regime.\nAPRA determined the actions of Mr Wilson and Mr Swanger in relation to this matter breached the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which was superseded by the FAR in March last year.\nAPRA sets requirements on ADIs’ minimum capital to ensure they can absorb unexpected losses in their business and to support financial system stability. It is a key pillar of APRA’s “unquestionably strong” capital requirements for Australian ADIs. Complying with laws and regulations governing capital raising and reporting is a key responsibility of accountable persons of ADIs.\nDeputy Chair Margaret Cole said the disqualifications demonstrate that APRA is willing to impose serious consequences on accountable persons who fail to comply with their obligations.\n“An accurate understanding of banks’ capital adequacy framework is essential for APRA to protect depositors by ensuring banks have the financial resilience to withstand a crisis. It is vital that accountable entities and accountable persons are open and cooperative with APRA so that it may effectively discharge its responsibilities for overseeing the safety and soundness of Australia's financial system.\n“These individuals failed to act in accordance with their duty to ensure Xinja had effective capital in place and to be open, constructive and cooperative with APRA in reporting Xinja’s capital position. These were serious failures and the disqualifications, which are the first under the FAR, reflect the gravity of this conduct.\n“The FAR means greater accountability standards for regulated entities, their directors and senior executives, and tougher consequences for when they are not met. APRA recognises that the actions of directors and senior executives shape the conduct and operating culture of the entities they lead. Where accountable persons fall short, APRA will hold them to account,” Ms Cole said.\nCraig Swanger\nDuring 2020, Mr Swanger was a non-executive director and an accountable person of Xinja.\nAPRA found that Mr Swanger failed to comply with his accountability obligations as an accountable person by:\nnot acting with honesty and integrity, and not dealing with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way, where in response to a request by an external investigator appointed by APRA for documents relating to arrangements with three of Xinja’s investors, Mr Swanger altered documents which he knew would be provided by Xinja to investigators appointed by APRA. The impact of these alterations was to remove content that showed that capital raised by Xinja was incorrectly classified as CET1 capital. Providing all relevant documents unaltered would have put APRA on notice that there had been a change to the investment documents and allowed APRA to further consider how and why those changes had occurred;\nnot acting with integrity in his involvement in Xinja’s entry into the side agreements with investors where he knew the capital raised under them was not CET1 capital, but would be classified as CET1 capital, and caused the disguise and obscuring of the substance of the capital;\nnot acting with due skill, care and diligence in raising capital for Xinja that he knew or should have known could not be CET1 capital and did not take steps to stop the capital being erroneously classified and reported to APRA as CET1 capital, and did not satisfy himself that agreements with an investor that required APRA’s consent had been provided by Xinja to APRA; and\nnot taking reasonable steps to prevent matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential standing of Xinja where he knew Xinja had erroneously reported capital raised as CET1 capital, did not take steps to provide the side agreements to APRA nor ascertain whether capital raised was misrepresented to APRA and did not take steps to put in place adequate procedures to stop Xinja erroneously classifying funds as CET1 capital.\nAPRA has disqualified Mr Swanger for a period of 10 years.\nEric Wilson\nDuring 2020, Mr Wilson was the CEO and an accountable person of Xinja.\nAPRA found that Mr Wilson failed to comply with his accountability obligations by:\nnot acting with due skill, care and diligence where Xinja raised capital that Mr Wilson knew or should have known could not be CET1 capital, which was misclassified and reported to APRA as CET1 capital, in circumstances where APRA was not informed of or provided with the side agreements relating to the capital raising. It would have been immediately apparent to Mr Wilson that there was a significant issue about whether capital raised in accordance with the side agreements could be classified as CET1 capital and he failed to take steps to stop the existence of the side agreements or stop the erroneous classification and reporting of CET1 capital;\nnot dealing with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way where APRA was not informed of the side agreements and in relation to concerns within Xinja of these side agreements’ impact on the capital that was raised. Mr Wilson knew or should have known of the impact of the side agreements on the status of Xinja’s CET1 capital and failed to advise APRA and/or failed to satisfy himself that APRA had been advised of this issue; and\nnot taking reasonable steps to prevent matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential standing of Xinja where he did not take steps to put in place adequate procedures to stop Xinja misclassifying the capital that was raised as CET1 capital.\nAPRA has disqualified Mr Wilson for a period of eight years. Mr Wilson’s relative disqualification period reflects that he did not breach his obligation to act with honesty and integrity under s 37CA(1)(a) of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth).\nFootnote\n1\nMr Wilson and Mr Swanger are also disqualified from being an accountable person of an authorised non-operating holding company (NOHC) of an ADI, and any significant related entity of an ADI or NOHC of an ADI.\nMedia enquiries\nContact APRA Media Unit, on\n+61 2 9210 3636\nAll other enquiries\nFor more information contact APRA on\n1300 558 849\n.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry.

Many of the consumers were First Nations Australians from regional, remote and very remote parts of Australia.</p>\n\n<p>“Optus’s conduct in this case was truly appalling, and we welcome the substantial penalty imposed by the Court and the deterrence message that it will send,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>“During the course of our investigation we heard from many people who had not only experienced significant financial harm, but also emotional distress and fear after being pursued by debt collectors for long periods.”</p>\n\n<p>“A company of Optus’s size should have had better systems and controls in place to identify and stop this sort of behaviour,” Ms Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>In his decision, Justice O’Sullivan said the consequences of Optus’s conduct were “profound”.</p>\n\n<p>“Numerous individuals experienced severe financial harm, emotional distress, and social shame,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“Particularly damaging was the heightened risk of losing access to essential telecommunications services when faced with inflated service costs.”</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the financial penalty, Optus has also provided the ACCC with a <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/undertakings-registers/optus-mobile-pty-ltd\">five-year court-enforceable undertaking</a> that it will compensate impacted consumers and improve its internal systems.</p>\n\n<p>Optus’s conduct impacted over 400 consumers and occurred at 16 Optus stores between August 2019 and July 2023. Any consumer who considers they may have been impacted by similar conduct should contact Optus.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of the misconduct included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>putting undue pressure on consumers to purchase a large number of products, including expensive phones and accessories, that they did not want or need, could not use or could not afford;</li>\n<li>failing to explain relevant terms and conditions to vulnerable consumers in a manner they could understand, resulting in them not understanding their ongoing payment obligations;</li>\n<li>not having regard to whether consumers had Optus coverage where they lived;</li>\n<li>selling products and services which Optus knew, or ought reasonably to have known, the consumers could not afford; and</li>\n<li>misleading these consumers to believe that goods were free or included as part of a bundle at no additional cost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Many impacted consumers were supported by local advocates, financial counsellors and carers in trying to seek a resolution with Optus. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“We commend the dedicated and hardworking people who assisted many of the affected consumers, and we also thank the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman for drawing the broader conduct to our attention,” Ms Lowe said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Optus’s Mount Isa store, which has now closed, the telco pursued debts in circumstances where its then senior management knew that those debts related to contracts for goods and services that appeared to have been entered into at the Optus Mount Isa Store fraudulently and without consumer knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Optus’s then senior management became increasingly aware that Optus staff were engaging in the inappropriate sales practices and that Optus’s systems and controls could not stop the conduct. Optus acknowledged it failed to promptly take steps to fix deficiencies in its systems, which allowed the conduct to continue.</p>\n\n<p>Commission-based sales arrangements for Optus’s sales staff had the clear potential to incentivise the inappropriate sales conduct, despite the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code requiring Optus, from 17 June 2022, to have regard to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/publications/consumer-vulnerability-a-business-guide-to-the-australian-consumer-law\">ACCC’s best practice recommendations</a> which recommend businesses avoid commission-based selling because of its potential to exacerbate the vulnerability of consumers.</p>\n\n<p>This case follows similar ACCC action against Telstra, which was ordered in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/telstra-to-pay-50m-penalty-for-unconscionable-sales-to-indigenous-consumers\">May 2021</a>&nbsp;to pay a $50 million penalty for engaging in unconscionable conduct when it sold mobile contracts to 108 First Nations Australians consumers between at least 1 January 2016 and about 27 August 2018.</p>\n\n<h2>Examples of the alleged conduct</h2>\n\n<p>A First Nations consumer visited an Optus store in a metro area. They were sold multiple Optus mobile plans and services, including two mobile phones, as well as accessories. The Optus sales representative manipulated the credit check, which enabled them to sell the consumer Optus services and products that they could not afford. Despite the details of the sale coming to the attention of Optus’s fraud team, the consumer’s debt in excess of $3,000 was referred to an external debt collection agency. The debt continued to be pursued by Optus for over a year.</p>\n\n<p>In a separate example, Optus entered into four contracts with a consumer who lived with deafness and communicated by Australian Sign Language. Optus staff failed to explain the terms of the consumer’s contract in a manner which they could understand. The consumer was on a disability pension, and the cost of the contracts was more than they could afford. In addition, the consumer did not need and could not use the Optus products and services. It was only with significant time and assistance of the consumer’s support worker that the consumer was able to cancel the contracts.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, an internal Optus investigation into customer accounts at the Optus store in Mount Isa resulted in a report that stated that the store manager had falsified identification documents and consumer information to create contracts for services, and had used the identities of First Nations consumers who were not aware that their identities had been used. Another report identified 82 contracts that appeared to have been fraudulently completed without consumer knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>After Optus was notified of the conduct that was the subject of the reports, including its senior management at the time, it still referred and sold outstanding debts associated with some of those contracts to third party debt collection and factoring agencies. Some consumers whose identities were associated with the relevant customer accounts were subject to threats of legal proceedings being commenced against them and of reporting defaults to credit reporting bodies. Some customers continued to be pursued by third party collections agencies until as late as July 2024 and Optus had not taken steps to stop that occurring.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC acknowledges Optus’s cooperation in resolving the Court proceedings at an early stage and providing a court-enforceable undertaking. The undertaking includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a 3-year consumer remediation program</li>\n<li>changes to remuneration and incentives for Optus sales staff designed to prevent further conduct from occurring</li>\n<li>a requirement for Optus to ensure that certain Optus Licensee stores in the Northern Territory, regional Queensland and South Australia are directly operated by Optus</li>\n<li>process and system changes, for example improvements to Optus’s complaints handling process for consumers experiencing vulnerability and/or disadvantage, and</li>\n<li>a $1 million donation to an organisation facilitating digital literacy of First Nations Australians. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Court also ordered Optus to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs, by consent.</p>\n\n<h2>Optus customer support</h2>\n\n<p>Consumers who think they may have been impacted by conduct similar to that <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/undertakings-registers/optus-mobile-pty-ltd\">outlined in Optus’s undertaking</a> to the ACCC can call Optus’s specialist customer care team on 1300 082 820 for further information or support.</p>\n\n<p>They can also visit the <a href=\"https://www.optus.com.au/support/sales-misconduct-update\">Sales Misconduct Response page</a> on Optus’s website.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p><em><strong>Questions regarding the recent Optus outage affecting triple-0 call services are unrelated to this judgment and should be directed to the <a href=\"https://www.acma.gov.au/acma-statement-optus-triple-zero-investigation\">Australian Communications and Media Authority</a> (ACMA).

The chat widget didn’t disclose any other charges, and the substantially higher ongoing monthly fee was not mentioned until consumers were directed to a payment screen.”\n“The monthly subscription fee was shown in a way that we believe many consumers would not have seen,” Ms Lowe said.\n“Manipulative online design practices which guide consumers to sign up for subscriptions they do not want or did not intend to buy can cause distress and financial loss.”\nIn addition to the alleged price misrepresentations, the ACCC alleges JustAnswer misled consumers by purporting that it or its services were sponsored or approved by, or otherwise affiliated with, the Fair Work Ombudsman, an Australian Ombudsman, or an Australian Government department.\n“We consider some consumers may have engaged with JustAnswer on the mistaken belief that their questions would be answered by an independent ombudsman, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman,” Ms Lowe said.\n“The ACCC commenced this investigation after receiving large numbers of complaints from consumers who claimed they were not aware of the ongoing subscription charges or who thought they were dealing with an Australian government body.”\nThe ACCC is seeking compensation orders for affected consumers, injunctions, civil pecuniary penalties, publication orders, and costs, as well as declarations that JustAnswer contravened consumer laws and the implementation of a compliance program.\nBackground\nJustAnswer is registered and based in the United States and operates its business in 196 countries, with more than 700 employees.\nIt provides a service connecting consumers to subject matter ‘experts’ in areas such as medicine, law, accounting and technology, who are available to answer consumers’ questions. This service can be accessed via\nJustAnswer’s website\nor its Android/iOS app, the latter of which is not subject to allegations in this proceeding.\nConsumers who use a search engine to find information on a particular topic may come across search results with links to JustAnswer’s website. This included search ads sponsored by JustAnswer.\nIn June, the ACCC published the tenth and final report of its\nDigital Platform Services Inquiry\n, which found consumers continue to face harms from unfair trading practices including manipulative design operations, such as using interfaces that direct consumers to more expensive subscriptions or purchase options, as well as undisclosed sponsorships and subscription traps. A subscription trap is when a business misleads a consumer into signing up for a subscription by representing that they are making a one-off purchase, or by making cancellation of a subscription difficult.\nConsumer issues in the digital economy are one of the ACCC’s current enforcement priorities. This includes work in addressing unfair subscription-related practices, including subscription traps.\nConcise Statement\nThis document contains the ACCC's initiating court document in relation to this matter. We will not be uploading further documents in the event these initial documents are subsequently amended.\nACCC v JustAnswer LLC - Concise Statement\n(\nPDF 626.58 KB\n)\nRelease number\n108/25\nGeneral enquiries\nSubmit an online enquiry\nto ask a question or you can\nmake a report\nto help us understand where there are problems.\nMedia enquiries\nmedia@accc.gov.au or 1300 138 917.

This was part of a global survey that involved central\nbanks and authorities from 52 jurisdictions and was coordinated by the Bank for International\nSettlements (BIS) to obtain comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of FX and\nOTC derivatives markets. Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986 for activity in\nFX markets and since 1995 for OTC interest rate derivatives markets.\nGlobally, the Australian dollar is the seventh most traded currency, down from sixth in the previous\nsurvey, and its share of turnover remained stable around 6 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the\nsixth most traded currency pair globally, accounting for around 5 per cent of all transactions.\nActivity in Australia’s FX market in April 2025 reached its highest level on record. The survey was\nconducted during a period of heightened FX volatility and a surge of trading activity following several\ntrade policy announcements by major economies. Average daily turnover in Australia’s FX market\nincreased by 34 per cent to US$201 billion per day in April 2025, from US$150 billion\nin April 2022.\n[1]\nAustralia’s FX market remains the the 11th largest in the world.\nIn the Australian FX market the majority of turnover remained in FX swaps, accounting for around\n53 per cent of total turnover. Spot transactions accounted for 25 per cent of\nAustralian turnover, up from 23 per cent in 2022, and outright forwards accounted for\n18 per cent of Australian turnover, little changed from the previous survey.\nActivity in the Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased sharply since the previous\nsurvey. Average daily turnover in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased by\n123 per cent to US$252 billion during April 2022, reflecting an increase in turnover of\ninterest rate swaps.\nThe preliminary results of the global turnover survey are available from the BIS website. The final data\nand related analysis will be released by the BIS in December 2025. Links to other participating\njurisdictions’ results are available from the BIS website.

    "full_text": "Media Release\nStatement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision\nNumber\n2025-27\nDate\n30 September 2025\nAt its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent.\nThe decline in underlying inflation has slowed.\nInflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to\nbring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. Both headline and trimmed mean\ninflation were within the\n2–3 per cent\nrange in the June quarter. Recent data, while partial\nand volatile, suggest that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of\nthe August\nStatement on Monetary Policy\n.\nDomestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain.\nData for the June quarter show that private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected,\ntaking over from public demand as the driver of growth. In particular, private consumption is picking up\nas real household incomes rise and measures of financial conditions ease. The housing market is\nstrengthening, a sign that recent interest rate decreases are having an effect. Credit is readily\navailable to both households and businesses.\nVarious indicators suggest that labour market conditions have been broadly steady in recent months and\nremain a little tight. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected, but the\nunemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 per cent in August. Measures of labour underutilisation\nremain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour has been little\nchanged of late. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but\nproductivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high.\nThere are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both\ndomestic and international developments. On the domestic side, stronger-than-expected data on growth and\ninflation may indicate that households have become more comfortable consuming as real incomes and wealth\nrise. If this continues, it may make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases and lead to more\ndemand for labour. Alternatively, the recent growth in consumption might not persist, particularly if\nhouseholds become more concerned about overseas developments.\nUncertainty in the global economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale\nof US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely\nto be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on\nglobal economic growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat\nto the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour\nmarket conditions in the domestic economy.\nThere are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing, the\nbalance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour\nmarket and the outlook for productivity.\nMaintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.\nWith signs that private demand is recovering, indications that inflation may be persistent in some areas\nand labour market conditions overall remaining stable, the Board decided that it was appropriate to\nmaintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the\nbeginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full\neffects of earlier cash rate reductions. The Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious,\nupdating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of\nuncertainty about the outlook. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to\ninternational developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in\nAustralia.\nThe Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its\ndecisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial\nmarkets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is\nfocused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers\nnecessary to achieve that outcome.\nDecision\nToday’s policy decision was unanimous.\nMore on the September 2025 monetary policy decision...\nMedia Conference\nGovernor Michele Bullock addresses the media after the monetary policy decision.\nMedia Conference\nMonetary Policy Minutes\nMinutes of the Reserve Bank Board meeting, published two weeks after the decision.\nMonetary Policy Minutes\nEnquiries\nCommunications Department\nReserve Bank of Australia\nSYDNEY\nPhone:\n+61 2 9551 8111\nEmail:\nrbainfo@rba.gov.au",

    "full_text": "Media Release\nAssessment of ASX Clearing and Settlement Facilities – September 2025\nNumber\n2025-25\nDate\n24 September 2025\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia today released the\n2025\nAssessment of the ASX Clearing and Settlement (CS)\nFacilities\n. This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank’s Financial\nStability Standards (Standards).\nASX has considerable work to do to meet the Bank’s expectations for an operator of critical market\ninfrastructure. Recent shortcomings in risk management – particularly the December 2024 CHESS batch\nsettlement incident – have highlighted that ASX must make foundational changes to its governance,\nculture and risk management processes. ASX must also accelerate its uplift of operational and financial\nrisk management, while meeting key milestones for its major technology projects. Delivering on these\ninitiatives will require appropriate resourcing and the RBA will be closely monitoring progress over the\ncoming year.\nThe ASX CS facilities were rated as having ‘observed’ or ‘broadly observed’ many of\nthe individual Standards.\nThe Bank assessed that one or more of the CS facilities ‘partly observed’ requirements under the\nspecific Standards on the Framework for Comprehensive Management of Risks, Governance, Credit Risk,\nSettlement Finality, and Operational Risk. ASX Clear and ASX Settlement continue to be rated as ‘not\nobserved’ on the Operational Risk Standard, following the Bank’s\nout-of-cycle\nassessment\nagainst this Standard in March 2025.\nThe Bank has issued a number of recommendations, including that ASX should:\nobtain assurance that it has addressed gaps in its risk appetite statement and strategy to return to\nrisk appetite\nensure its risk transformation plan is appropriately resourced and implement regular reporting on the\nplan\nconduct a review of business continuity and contingency arrangement across the CS facilities\ncomprehensively improve data and reporting controls for financial risk models and address issues\nidentified in the assessment period.\nRBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said:\n‘ASX is not currently meeting\nthe regulators’ expectations for an operator of critical national infrastructure. Resilient and\nsecure CS facilities are crucial to the stability of the Australian financial system.\n‘This assessment highlights that ASX still has more work to do to in strengthening its governance, risk\nculture, and frameworks for managing operational and financial risk. We are expecting meaningful progress\nover the coming year and will consider further regulatory responses if necessary.’\nBackground\nThe Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on\nfinancial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed\non a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards determined by the Bank.\nThe Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX’s four CS facilities: two central counterparties –\nASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited – and two securities settlement\nfacilities – ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited. These assessments include a rating\nof the CS facilities’ observance against each financial stability standard.\nFor more information on the Bank’s approach to assessing CS facilities, see:\nThe\nReserve Bank’s Approach to Supervising and Assessing Clearing and Settlement Facility\nLicensees\n.\nASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the supervision of CS facilities. In carrying\nout supervision of CS facilities, the RBA works closely with ASIC.\nEnquiries\nCommunications Department\nReserve Bank of Australia\nSYDNEY\nPhone:\n+61 2 9551 8111\nEmail:\nrbainfo@rba.gov.au",

    "full_text": "Media Release\nPayments System Board Update: August 2025 Meeting\nNumber\n2025-23\nDate\n28 August 2025\nAt its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including:\nThe regulatory response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024.\nThe\nBoard reviewed ASX’s plans to ensure the current CHESS is adequately operated, maintained and\nsupported as a critical financial market infrastructure. Members noted that early progress is being\nmade and agreed that significant concerns remain. The Board also agreed on further regulatory steps to ensure CHESS\nReplacement is designed with an appropriate level of resilience for critical financial market\ninfrastructure.\nThe annual Assessment of the ASX clearing and settlement facilities against the Financial\nStability Standards\n. The Board endorsed the RBA’s Assessment, which will be\npublished after it has been provided to ASX, the Treasurer and the Australian Securities and\nInvestments Commission. Members observed that ASX has made limited progress in addressing the\nRBA’s fundamental concerns in relation to operational resilience and risk management over the\npast year. ASX’s response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024 and its aftermath\nhas also demonstrated that ASX must take urgent steps to improve its governance and risk culture. The\nsuccessful delivery of ASX’s current risk management, technology and transformation initiatives\nis crucial to the continuity of services that are critical to the stability of the Australian\nfinancial system.\nThe RBA’s oversight of international financial market infrastructures\n, including\nLCH SwapClear, CME, Clearstream Banking, Euroclear Bank, CLS and Swift. Many of these infrastructures\nare engaged in complex, multi-year transformation programs to modernise systems and enhance\nresilience. Members emphasised the importance of strong project governance, testing and migration\nstrategies to support the ongoing safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. Members also\ndiscussed the risks associated with growing reliance by financial market infrastructures on a small\nnumber of critical third-party service providers. The Board welcomed ASIC’s decision to grant\nClearstream Banking a clearing and settlement facility licence. Members highlighted the importance of\nthe RBA and ASIC, as co-regulators of clearing and settlement facilities operating in Australia,\nhaving sufficient oversight of such facilities.\nThe system-wide resilience of the Australian payments system.\nThe Board highlighted\nthe growing importance of operational resilience in the context of a more complex and challenging\nenvironment for operational risk in the payments system. Regulators and entities will need to increase their\nfocus on system-wide interdependencies. The Board endorsed an ongoing research program examining\ninteroperability, third-party and concentration risks, resilience arrangements for high-value\npayments and the vulnerability of the payments system to utilities outages.\nThe future of cash distribution arrangements.\nMembers discussed the challenges in\nthe cash distribution system. There is an ongoing need for industry cooperation to work towards a more\ndurable future distribution system that supports the availability of cash in the community, including in\nrural and regional Australia. Cash remains an important means of payment for many Australians and can\nplay a valuable role as a back-up to electronic payments, as part of a resilient and inclusive\npayments ecosystem. Members noted that a new proposed regulatory framework for providers of cash\ndistribution services, which was the subject of a recent CFR and ACCC consultation, should contribute\nto the management of risks relating to the continuity of cash distribution services across Australia.\nReview of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging.\nThe Board was provided with an\nupdate on the initial responses of stakeholders to the Consultation Paper published in July. Members\nnoted feedback regarding the potential impact of the proposed card payments regulations on the\nability of small issuers and fintechs to compete and innovate. Members held a preliminary discussion\non whether there is a case to reduce the regulatory burden of card payments regulations on small\nissuers and what options might best support this objective. The issue will be considered further as\npart of the consultation process for the Review.\nGlobal developments in stablecoins.\nMembers discussed the recent sharp growth in\nthe global stablecoin market, noting the market is largely concentrated in a small number of\nUS dollar stablecoins. Members discussed the expansion in potential use cases for stablecoins,\nincluding as a means of payment and in cross-border transactions. They also considered the emerging\nregulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. While the stablecoin market in Australia is currently\nvery small, members discussed a range of potential domestic implications if the use of stablecoins\nwere to grow considerably. The Board also welcomed the Government’s proposed reforms aimed at\nensuring that stored-value facilities, including stablecoins, operate under a strong regulatory and\nlicencing regime.\nEnquiries\nCommunications Department\nReserve Bank of Australia\nSYDNEY\nPhone:\n+61 2 9551 8111\nEmail:\nrbainfo@rba.gov.au",

    "full_text": "More on the August 2025 monetary policy decision\nMedia Release\nStatement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision\nNumber\n2025-22\nDate\n12 August 2025\nAt its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to\n3.60 per cent.\nInflation has continued to moderate.\nInflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to\nbring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. In the June quarter, trimmed mean\ninflation over the year fell to 2.7 per cent, broadly as expected in May. Headline inflation,\nwhich has partly been affected by temporary cost of living relief measures, was 2.1 per cent,\nalso as forecast. Updated staff forecasts for the August meeting suggest that underlying inflation will\ncontinue to moderate to around the midpoint of the\n2–3 per cent\nrange, with the cash rate assumed to follow a\ngradual easing path.\nThe outlook remains uncertain.\nUncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale\nof US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely\nto be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on\nglobal economic activity, and there remains a risk that households and firms delay expenditure pending\nstill greater clarity on the outlook. As in May, the forecasts assume that both effects weigh on activity\nand inflation in Australia for a period.\nDomestically, private demand appears to have been recovering gradually, real household incomes have picked\nup and some measures of financial conditions have eased.\nVarious indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, although have eased\nfurther in recent months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in the month of June and\naveraged 4.2 per cent in the June quarter as a whole, in line with the May forecasts. Measures\nof labour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that\navailability of labour is still a constraint for a range of employers. Looking through quarterly\nvolatility, wages growth has eased from its peak but productivity growth has not picked up and growth in\nunit labour costs remains high.\nThere are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both\ndomestic and international developments. The forecasts released today are for the recovery in household\nconsumption growth to be sustained as real incomes rise. Businesses in some sectors, however, continue to\nreport that weakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases to final prices. There is\na risk that consumption growth is a little slower than expected, which could weigh on growth in aggregate\ndemand and lead to weaker labour market conditions. Alternatively, as real incomes and wealth continue to\nrise, households might choose to consume more and save less than expected. Labour market outcomes may\nalso prove stronger than expected, given the signal from a range of leading indicators.\nThere are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how\nfirms’ pricing decisions and wages will respond to the balance between aggregate demand and\npotential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and continued weak productivity\noutcomes.\nMaintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.\nWith underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the\n2–3 per cent\nrange and labour market conditions easing\nslightly, as expected, the Board judged that a further easing of monetary policy was appropriate. This\ntakes the decline in the cash rate since the beginning of the year to 75 basis points. The Board\nnevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty\nabout both aggregate demand and potential supply. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond\ndecisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and\ninflation in Australia.\nThe Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions. In\ndoing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends\nin domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its\nmandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve\nthat outcome.\nDecision\nToday’s policy decision was unanimous.\nMore on the August 2025 monetary policy decision...\nMedia Conference\nGovernor Michele Bullock addresses the media after the monetary policy decision.\nMedia Conference\nMonetary Policy Minutes\nMinutes of the Reserve Bank Board meeting, published two weeks after the decision.\nMonetary Policy Minutes\nStatement on Monetary Policy\nThe RBA's assessment of the economy that the Board considered in making its decision.\nStatement on Monetary Policy\nEnquiries\nCommunications Department\nReserve Bank of Australia\nSYDNEY\nPhone:\n+61 2 9551 8111\nEmail:\nrbainfo@rba.gov.au",
