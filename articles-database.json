Mr Muir appeared at the Perth Magistrate’s Court on 23 January 2026 for first mention. At the time of the alleged offence, Mr Muir was the director of JW Tiling & Stone Pty Ltd, a company which operated a wall and floor tiling business in the Perth Metropolitan Area. Following an ASIC investigation, it is alleged that on 12 July 2024, Mr Muir authorised the lodgement of a form to deregister the company which contained a declaration that the company had no outstanding liabilities, knowing that declaration was false because the company owed over $195,000 to a creditor. The matter was adjourned to 6 March 2026 for Mr Muir to obtain legal advice. Mr Muir was placed on bail with a personal undertaking of $5,000. This matter is being prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP). The maximum penalty for the alleged offence is five years imprisonment when heard summarily in the Magistrates Court.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The Federal Court has ordered Australian Unity Funds Management Limited (Australian Unity) to pay a $7.125 million pecuniary penalty for breaching design and distribution obligations (DDO) by failing to confirm the suitability of one of its products for retail investors. As responsible entity of the Australian Unity Select Income Fund (Fund), Australian Unity admitted that it failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that interests in the Fund were only distributed to investors who matched the criteria outlined in its three Target Market Determinations (TMDs) for the Fund. As a result, hundreds of retail investors were able to invest in the Fund even though the product may not have been suitable for them under those TMDs. Australian Unity, also known as AUFM, admitted that it issued interests in the Fund to retail clients: on 89 occasions without requiring them to submit, as part of their application, a completed questionnaire with answers to questions to determine whether they were within the target market described in the Fund TMDs, and on 239 occasions without reviewing submitted questionnaires that had been completed by them to determine whether they were within the target market described in the Fund TMDs. Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘Australian Unity breached the design and distribution obligations and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure its retail product distribution conduct, in this case, the issuing of interests in the Fund, aligned with its target market determinations.’ ‘There is no value to investors if product issuers develop a target market determination for a product but fail to take steps to ensure that those products are distributed consistently with the target market determination.’ In this case, of 328 non-advised investors who applied to acquire an interest in the Fund, 89 were not required to submit a questionnaire to assess their suitability. Of the other 239 who did submit responses, up to 144 of them provided at least one response that suggested they were not in the target market for the Fund. ‘The failure to assess product suitability for investors can expose them to products which are not appropriate for them and create the potential for financial loss. ‘This outcome sends a clear message to product issuers that there are significant consequences for failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that investors are within a product’s target market before they issue interests in the product’, the Deputy Chair said. His Honour Justice Moshinsky said in his reasons published today that Australian Unity’s ‘failings are serious. Moreover, there is no satisfactory explanation for how they came about. ‘…[T]he explanation is essentially that the person tasked with ensuring compliance with the DDO regime (the DDO Project Manager) did not have appropriate experience or training. ‘This reflects poorly on the ‘compliance culture’ of AUFM at the time. It suggests that AUFM did not take its regulatory obligations sufficiently seriously. Elsewhere, His Honour observed that specific investors identified in the judgment: ‘...were exposed to the risk that they might have obtained a financial product that was not appropriate to their objectives, financial situation or needs, and to the risk of financial loss…,’. In addition to the pecuniary penalty, the Court has ordered that Australian Unity publish a written adverse publicity notice and send the notice directly to the last known email or postal address of impacted investors, being those who were either not required to submit a completed questionnaire as part of their application, or whose submitted questionnaires were not reviewed by Australian Unity and included at least one response which indicated that they were not in the target market for the Fund. Australian Unity has also been ordered to pay ASIC’s costs of these proceedings. Downloads Judgment Background Orders were made by the Federal Court of Australia in December 2025, and written reasons were published on 30 January 2026. Australian Unity is the responsible entity of the Fund and between 5 October 2021 and 5 October 2023, it made three TMDs identifying the class of suitable investors for the Fund. Australian Unity admitted that it contravened s 994E(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). On 6 October 2023, Australian Unity updated the Fund TMD to include new distribution conditions which require Australian Unity to review responses to questionnaires prior to issuing interests in the Fund to prospective investors. Since October 2023, it has made the questionnaire compulsory for prospective investors and from July 2024, the questionnaires included ‘knock out questions’. The DDO regime requires financial product issuers and distributors to develop and maintain effective product governance arrangements across the life cycle of financial products. It requires product issuers to make a TMD by, among other things, identifying the class of retail clients that comprise the target market for their products. The maker of the TMD must take reasonable steps to ensure that the product is issued and distributed consistently with the TMD.",

    "full_text": "Date 29 January 2026 Topics Mergers and acquisitions Food and groceries The ACCC has decided that Coles Group Limited’s acquisition of a lease for a supermarket and liquor store in Kalgoorlie, WA requires an in-depth assessment. As the ACCC has not approved the acquisition in its Phase 1 assessment, it will require a Phase 2 review for the acquisition to proceed. The acquisition of the lease relates to a development proposed for a vacant site in Kalgoorlie, WA where Coles is proposing to operate a large format supermarket and liquor store. Coles already operates one existing supermarket and three Liquorland liquor stores in Kalgoorlie. “We consider the acquisition could substantially lessen competition for the retail supply of groceries in Kalgoorlie,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. The acquisition is likely to provide Coles with a significant market share for the retail supply of groceries in a local market where competitive constraint from rival supermarkets may be limited and timely new entry may be unlikely. The ACCC is also considering whether the acquisition may create, strengthen or entrench Coles’ substantial market power in the local market. The ACCC has not reached a conclusion on the issues and will continue to consider the acquisition in Phase 2. “We believe this acquisition needs an in-depth assessment to understand the likely impact it will have on competition in Kalgoorlie,” Mr Keogh said. “We look forward to speaking to more industry participants and interested parties in the coming weeks.” The ACCC invites submissions in response to its Phase 2 Notice by 13 February 2026. Parties can contact the ACCC via mergers@accc.gov.au .

The issue occurred at around 10:30 am and resulted in some file based payments being unable to be processed. The cause of the outage was identified, and services were progressively restored, with file exchange services becoming available from around 5:20 pm the same day. The Fast Settlement Service was not affected. A subsequent issue further delayed some PEXA property settlements, resulting in around 500 property transactions not being completed before the end of the settlement day, which was extended to 10:45 pm. The Reserve Bank has been working closely with industry participants and remains in regular contact to support recovery and resolution. Following the restoration of RBA services on Tuesday, financial institutions were able to resume exchanging payment files and progressively process payments, including those delayed by the outage. The RBA apologises for the disruption caused and recognises the impact this would have had on financial institutions and their customers. As there have been no further system issues at the RBA since late Tuesday evening, customers experiencing difficulties with transactions or payment delays should contact their own financial institution to discuss the matter.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email 28 self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) auditors had their registrations cancelled, conditions imposed on them, or were disqualified by ASIC in the first half of the 25-26 financial year. SMSF auditors are responsible for providing assurance over the $1 trillion in retirement savings held in Australia’s 661,000 SMSF accounts. They must act as trusted gatekeepers who contribute to the integrity and confidence in the SMSF regime. Between 1 July 2025 and 31 December 2025, ASIC: disqualified 4 SMSF auditors, imposed additional conditions on 2 SMSF auditors, and cancelled the registration of 22 SMSF auditors. ASIC took this action after finding breaches of professional obligations and standards, including: failing to comply with auditing and assurance standards, independence and continuing professional development requirements or to hold professional indemnity insurance, failing to provide ASIC with annual statements, failing to advise ASIC of changes to their contact details on the public register of SMSF auditors and not responding to regulatory compliance requests, and failing to carry out enough audit work to meet the practical experience requirements. Andy Choi, Robert Morey, Andrew Orphanides and Ermis Yianni were disqualified from being SMSF auditors. John Couroyannis and Dawid Maj had additional conditions imposed on their SMSF auditor registrations. The specific conditions can be viewed by searching the SMSF auditor’s name in ASIC's Professional Registers Search . Of the 22 auditors who had their registrations cancelled, 9 were cancelled over a failure to perform any significant audit work during the last 5 years. These auditors were referred to ASIC by the ATO, further adding to the 11 auditors who had their registrations cancelled last year as part of the ATO's ongoing project to identify auditors who fail to maintain the necessary practical experience. These auditors were Yvonne Ching, Patrick Hoey, Christopher Leech, Rochelle Massih, Barry Mendel, Rick Siew, Thien Siow, John Whiting and Weifeng Zhu. Ahmed Afifi and Fredel Twum were cancelled for not updating their contact details on the public register and failing to respond to regulatory compliance requests. The registrations of 11 SMSF auditors were cancelled by ASIC for failing to comply with their obligation to lodge multiple annual statements. Increased scrutiny on in-house audit independence breaches ASIC has also increased its scrutiny on in-house audits, which occur when auditors audit the financial statements of SMSF clients they or their firm also provide accounting services to. Two of the 4 auditors disqualified in the last 6 months – Mr Orphanides and Mr Yianni – were disqualified because ASIC found they continued auditing SMSFs whose financial statements were prepared by staff in their own firm. ASIC contends that this conduct continued even after ASIC had previously imposed extra conditions on their SMSF auditor registrations to address this very issue. Since 2020, auditors are explicitly prohibited from auditing SMSF financial statements where their firm provides accounting services, including preparing financial statements, unless the accounting services are routine or mechanical and any independence threats created by providing those services are reduced an acceptable level. However, a 2025 review by the ATO indicated that up to 800 SMSF auditors may still be performing in-house audits , so this risk continues to remain a focus on the ATO’s compliance program. Where SMSF auditor conduct falls short, ASIC will continue to act. More information ASIC's SMSF auditors webpage and Regulatory Guide 243 Registration of self-managed superannuation fund auditors . ASIC's Professional Registers Search contains publicly available registered SMSF auditor current status and details. ATO’s website: SMSF auditor independence compliance focuses . Background Approved SMSF auditors are registered with ASIC under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 ( SIS Act ). ASIC and the ATO work closely together as co-regulators of SMSF auditors. The ATO monitors SMSF auditor conduct and may decide to refer matters to ASIC. ASIC also monitors the SMSF auditor population for non-compliance and is empowered to disqualify, suspend, cancel or impose additional conditions on the registration of SMSF auditors. ASIC may: make an order disqualifying or suspending a person from being an approved SMSF auditor, under section 130F of the SIS Act, if the person has failed to carry out or perform adequately and properly the duties and functions of an auditor or is not a fit and proper person to be an approved SMSF auditor. The order disqualifying a person from being an approved SMSF auditor must be published by notifiable instrument detailed in the Notifiable ASIC instruments listing. A disqualified SMSF auditor is placed on ASIC’s public banned and disqualified register and is not eligible to reapply for registration unless the disqualification is revoked. Suspension orders are not notifiable instruments, however the approved SMSF auditor status in the register will show ‘suspended’ during the time of suspension. impose conditions on an SMSF auditor’s registration under section 128D of the SIS Act at any time by giving written notice. cancel the registration of an SMSF auditor under section 128E of the SIS Act for non-compliance with conditions, ceasing to have the practical experience necessary for carrying out audits of SMSFs, failing to lodge annual statements in the required timeframe or ceasing to be an Australian resident. SMSF auditors have the right to seek review of decisions that ASIC makes in relation to their registration under the SIS Act. They may request that ASIC reconsider a decision it has made against them. If the decision is confirmed or varied the SMSF auditor may apply to the ART for further review of the confirmed or varied decision. Mr Morey and Mr Yianni requested ASIC reconsider its disqualification decision and in each case the disqualifications were confirmed. Mr Morey has applied to the Administrative Review Tribunal ( ART ) for review of the decision to disqualify him. Mr Yianni has advised ASIC that he has applied to the ART for review of the decision to disqualify him. APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) was restructured effective 1 January 2020 to prohibit auditors from auditing SMSF financial statements where their firm provides accounting services, including preparing financial statements, unless the accounting services are routine or mechanical and any independence threats created by providing those services are reduced an acceptable level.",

    "full_text": "Insight APRA Explains: APRA’s role in private health insurance premium increases Wednesday 28 January 2026 Print Email Every year, private health insurers apply for approval to change the premiums they charge policyholders. By law, private health insurers are unable to change their premiums without approval from the Minister for Health, Disability and Ageing (the Minister). The approval process, known as the private health insurance (PHI) premium round , attracts significant attention due to the impact on policyholders and debate over whether the premium changes are appropriate. While premium increases are rarely welcomed by policyholders, it's essential for private health insurers to maintain their ability to pay claims and meet other commitments. When expenses for insurers rise – for example through higher claim payments due to inflation or insurers needing to be more vigilant on information security threats, premiums should take into account these higher costs. That's where APRA comes in. A trusted advisor As Australia's prudential regulator for PHI,  APRA is responsible for making sure that insurers have the ability to meet obligations to policyholders, including payment of claims. APRA’s overarching responsibility is to ensure that regulated entities can meet their commitments to policyholders under all reasonable circumstances. As a result, the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing (the Department) requests APRA’s view on the implications of each private health insurer’s application to change premiums. Specifically, APRA’s role is to advise the Department on whether premium increase requests would result in an \"adverse prudential outcome\", which includes: an insurer being unable to pay claims or deliver other member services; and an insurer being unable to sustain its business. APRA does not approve premium increases . Rather, APRA – as an important stakeholder in the PHI industry – is an advisor to the Department. Approval process The PHI premium round usually occurs once a year and involves all insurers applying for premium changes at the same time.

    "full_text": "Insight APRA explains: APRA’s role in private health insurance premium round Wednesday 28 January 2026 Print Email Every year, private health insurers apply for approval to change the premiums they charge policyholders. By law, private health insurers are unable to change their premiums without approval from the Minister for Health, Disability and Ageing (the Minister). The approval process, known as the private health insurance (PHI) premium round , attracts significant attention due to the impact on policyholders and debate over whether the premium changes are appropriate. While premium increases are rarely welcomed by policyholders, it's essential for private health insurers to maintain their ability to pay claims and meet other commitments. When expenses for insurers rise – for example through higher claim payments due to inflation or insurers needing to be more vigilant on information security threats, premiums should take into account these higher costs. That's where APRA comes in. A trusted advisor As Australia's prudential regulator for PHI, APRA is responsible for making sure that insurers have the ability to meet obligations to policyholders, including payment of claims. APRA’s overarching responsibility is to ensure that regulated entities can meet their commitments to policyholders under all reasonable circumstances. As a result, the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing (the Department) requests APRA’s view on the implications of each private health insurer’s application to change premiums. Specifically, APRA’s role is to advise the Department on whether premium increase requests would result in an \"adverse prudential outcome\", which includes: an insurer being unable to pay claims or deliver other member services; and an insurer being unable to sustain its business. APRA does not approve premium increases . Rather, APRA – as an important stakeholder in the PHI industry – is an advisor to the Department. Approval process The PHI premium round usually occurs once a year and involves all insurers applying for premium changes at the same time. Typically, insurers’ applications are submitted to the Department in November for changes to apply from 1 April the following year. The process is conducted by the Department and any changes to PHI premiums must be approved by the Minister. This is a requirement under section 66(10) of the Private Health Insurance Act 2007, where the Minister must approve the proposed change unless it is contrary to the public interest.

ACCC issued it with two ACCC infringement notices.</p>\n\n<p>SIA Booking Group Corporation, which operates under the name EconomyBookings, allegedly breached Australian Consumer Law in the way it displayed prices to consumers on its website.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC alleges that EconomyBookings, in the booking process on its website, failed to prominently display the total price for car rental services as a single figure and made a false or misleading representation about whether a pre-selected optional extra was included in the rental price.</p>\n\n<p>“Any business offering goods or services to Australian consumers must comply with Australian Consumer Law,” ACCC Commissioner Luke Woodward said.</p>\n\n<p>“Businesses must prominently display the total price of goods and services as a single figure, inclusive of selected optional extras.”</p>\n\n<p>“All businesses, including online providers, should ensure that their pricing displays do not mislead consumers, or they may face enforcement action by the ACCC,” Mr Woodward said.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC alleges that in the early stages of the booking process, EconomyBookings displayed a price for a car rental on its website that did not prominently specify the rental price, including the pre-selected optional extras, as a single figure.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-selected optional extras included “Last Minute Cancellation”, “Roadside assistance” and “Full coverage” for insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The ACCC also alleges that EconomyBookings showed a pre-selected optional extra in its online booking process for a car rental under a heading “<i>Your car rental includes</i>” next to a price that did not include the price for that optional extra.</p>\n\n<p>“We allege that EconomyBookings made a false or misleading representation early in the booking process that the displayed price included the cost of the pre-selected extra option when it did not,” Mr Woodward said.</p>\n\n<p>In one example, the initial car price displayed was $147.10, but the total price charged with the pre-selected optional extras was $315.04.</p>\n\n<p><i>Screenshot of the ‘Options page’ on the EconomyBookings website on 20 August 2025, showing the

    "full_text": "Date 28 January 2026 Topics Buying and selling products and services Compliance and enforcement An international car rental booking platform has paid a penalty of $39,600 after the ACCC issued it with two ACCC infringement notices. SIA Booking Group Corporation, which operates under the name EconomyBookings, allegedly breached Australian Consumer Law in the way it displayed prices to consumers on its website. The ACCC alleges that EconomyBookings, in the booking process on its website, failed to prominently display the total price for car rental services as a single figure and made a false or misleading representation about whether a pre-selected optional extra was included in the rental price. “Any business offering goods or services to Australian consumers must comply with Australian Consumer Law,” ACCC Commissioner Luke Woodward said. “Businesses must prominently display the total price of goods and services as a single figure, inclusive of selected optional extras.” “All businesses, including online providers, should ensure that their pricing displays do not mislead consumers, or they may face enforcement action by the ACCC,” Mr Woodward said. The ACCC alleges that in the early stages of the booking process, EconomyBookings displayed a price for a car rental on its website that did not prominently specify the rental price, including the pre-selected optional extras, as a single figure. Pre-selected optional extras included “Last Minute Cancellation”, “Roadside assistance” and “Full coverage” for insurance. The ACCC also alleges that EconomyBookings showed a pre-selected optional extra in its online booking process for a car rental under a heading “ Your car rental includes ” next to a price that did not include the price for that optional extra. “We allege that EconomyBookings made a false or misleading representation early in the booking process that the displayed price included the cost of the pre-selected extra option when it did not,” Mr Woodward said. In one example, the initial car price displayed was $147.10, but the total price charged with the pre-selected optional extras was $315.04. Screenshot of the ‘Options page’ on the EconomyBookings website on 20 August 2025, showing the pre-selected extra options but the price of $147.10 does not include the options Screenshot of the ‘Details and payment page’ on the EconomyBookings website on 20 August 2025 showing the actual total price of $315.04, which includes the pre-selected extra options More information about the laws about how businesses must display their prices is available on the ACCC website . Background EconomyBookings is an online car rental booking platform, which provides a car rental price comparison and booking services for third-party car rental companies. The ACCC does not allege that the third-party companies were involved in the alleged conduct. EconomyBookings is the operating name of SIA Booking Group Corporation, which has its headquarters in Riga, Latvia. Note to editors The ACCC can issue an infringement notice when it has reasonable grounds to believe a person or business has contravened certain consumer protection provisions in the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The payment of a penalty specified in an infringement notice is not an admission of a contravention of the ACL. The ACL sets the penalty amount.

At the time of offending, Mr Gunn was a director of Mormarkets Pty Ltd (Mormarkets), a company that accepted deposits from Australians for cryptocurrency and other supposed investment opportunities. While Mormarkets’ bank accounts were in operation, Mr Gunn was repeatedly notified of suspicious activity or reports of fraud, with the accounts progressively closed. On the closure of two Mormarkets bank accounts, between March 2020 and May 2020 Mr Gunn received two bank cheques which included proceeds of investment amounts totalling $181,000. Mr Gunn admitted that he then dealt with the bank cheques by sending them to an associate. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth)(CDPP) and Mr Gunn consented to the matter being dealt with for sentence in the local court. Mr Gunn faces a maximum penalty in the Local Court of one year imprisonment, a fine of $12,600, or both. The matter is next listed in the Downing Centre Local Court on 10 February 2026 for mention to obtain a sentencing date. This matter is being prosecuted by the CDPP following an investigation and referral from ASIC.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The Federal Court has found BPS Financial Pty Ltd ( BPS Financial ) must pay $14 million in pecuniary penalties over its promotion and operation of its ‘Qoin Wallet’ crypto product. BPS Financial promoted the Qoin Wallet as a non-cash payment facility linked to a digital crypto token called ‘Qoin’. In 2024, the Federal Court found that BPS Financial engaged in unlicensed conduct over almost three years by issuing and providing financial advice about the Qoin Wallet without holding an Australian Financial Services License. The Court also found that BPS Financial engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct when it made several false and misleading representations about the Qoin Wallet. In 2025, the Full Federal Court found that BPS Financial engaged in unlicensed conduct over an additional 10-month period because BPS could not rely on the ‘authorised representative’ exemption under the Corporations Act when issuing the Qoin Wallet. The Court has today ordered BPS Financial is to pay total penalties of $14 million, made up of: $2 million for unlicensed conduct, and $12 million for misleading and deceptive conduct in connection with making false and misleading statements. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the outcome sent a strong message to the crypto industry. ‘The size of these penalties underscores the seriousness of BPS Financial’s misconduct and is intended to send a strong message of deterrence to the digital asset industry. ‘Given the nature of these products, providers must have the appropriate licenses and authorisations, and investors must be able to make decisions based on clear and correct statements, especially as crypto products can be highly volatile, inherently risky and complex. ‘ASIC will not hesitate to act where investors are potentially exposed to unlicensed financial advice, misleading and deceptive conduct, and risky products. ‘The digital asset industry is well on notice that its products will continue to be a focus for ASIC. We want to encourage innovation and new services for consumers, but not at their expense,’ the Chair said. In delivering her judgement, Justice Downes stated BPS ‘engaged in serious and unlawful misconduct during the period from January 2020 until mid-2023’. Her Honour said the $2 million penalty for the unlicensed conduct achieves the primary purpose of deterrence, both to BPS and to the digital asset industry as a whole. Her Honour also said the cumulative penalty of $12 million for the misleading representations ‘properly reflects the mitigating factors while also accounting for the objective recklessness of the conduct, involvement of senior management, the serious and misleading nature of the representations, the characteristics of the target audience and BPS’s inadequate compliance systems’. In addition to the pecuniary penalties, the Court also ordered: BPS be permanently restrained from making any false or misleading representation concerning the number of holders of the Qoin Wallet, the ability of Qoin Tokens to be exchanged for fiat or other crypto-assets, and that the Qoin Wallet has been officially approved and/or officially registered, BPS be restrained for 10 years from carrying on a financial services business without holding an Australian financial services licence, BPS publish an adverse publicity notice on the Qoin Wallet application and take steps to request the publisher of the ‘qoin.com’ website to also publish an adverse publicity notice, and BPS pay most of the costs incurred by ASIC for the proceeding.

In January 2025, Mr Petrovic sought a review of a decision to ban him for six years which was made by a delegate of ASIC. The Administrative Review Tribunal heard the matter in June and July 2025. The decision to vary the ban was issued on 11 December 2025. ART Decision: Petrovic and Australian Securities & Investments Commission ARTA 2717 (11 December 2025) . Background Mr Petrovic was banned from providing financial services, performing any function involved in carrying on of a financial services business and controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business for six years effective from January 2025 25-185MR . Mr Petrovic applied to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of ASIC’s decision. Mr Petrovic also applied for stay and confidentiality orders and that application has been withdrawn. The substantive review application was heard on 30 June and 1 and 2 July 2025. The banning took effect from 15 January 2025, was stayed on an interim basis on 28 February 2025, and resumed on 26 March 2025 when that stay was dissolved. The banning arose from Mr Petrovic’s role as a financial adviser of UGC. ASIC was concerned that UGC and its representatives gave conflicted personal advice to clients, specifically those advised to establish a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) and invest in highly speculative investments related to Joel Hewish (UGC’s director).

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The District Court of Western Australia has sentenced former financial advisor, Anthony Paul Torre, to six years imprisonment, backdated to commence on 29 January 2025. Mr Torre will be eligible for parole after serving four years of his sentence. Mr Torre was sentenced in relation to three counts of stealing and two counts of fraud resulting in the misappropriation of a total of $1,030,000 of clients’ superannuation funds during the period March 2010 and January 2015, contrary to sections 378 and 409 of the Criminal Code (WA). Mr Torre pleaded guilty to these offences on 28 January 2025, the day his trial for these offences was due to commence. Mr Torre’s victims included a couple over the age of 60 who were defrauded $500,000 and another man over the age of 60 who had $150,000 stolen. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘Mr Torre betrayed the trust of his clients and left many of them financially devastated. ‘The sentence imposed by the Court demonstrates the seriousness of the financial harm Mr Torre caused his clients and sends a clear message that misconduct predicated on trust will not be tolerated,’ the Deputy Chair said. When handing down the sentence, Judge Prior remarked, ‘This was a gross breach of trust…. The victims entrusted you with some of their life savings, their superannuation’s funds, which they’d worked hard for over the years and were hoping to utilise or enjoy in their retirement…. The victims in each case were vulnerable because you had easy access to their money and they trusted you as a professional financial advisor... I find your offending was due to a combination of greed, incompetence and arrogance…. I must impose a sentence that will deter other professionals such as financial advisors who might be minded to think that they can use their client’s money inconsistently and against their clients' instructions and authorities.’ As a result of Mr Torre’s conviction, he is automatically disqualified from managing companies for five years. The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) following an investigation and referral by ASIC. Background In June 2022, Anthony Paul Torre was charged with five counts of stealing and eight counts of fraud pursuant to sections 378 and 409 of the Criminal Code (WA) ( 22-151MR ). It was alleged that between March 2010 and January 2015, Mr Torre stole, or with intent to defraud obtained, approximately $1.882 million from his clients. It was alleged that Mr Torre used funds from his clients’ accounts for his own benefit. On 28 January 2025, Mr Torre pleaded guilty to five charges ( 25-006MR ). Under the Criminal Code (WA), the maximum penalty for each offence of stealing is seven years imprisonment, and for fraud seven years imprisonment or ten years if the person deceived is aged over 60 years.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Former investment manager Rodney Forrest has been sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment for insider trading and procuring others to trade in more than $3 million of Platinum Asset Management Limited (Platinum) shares (ASX: PTM). In August 2024, Mr Forrest secretly accessed the computer of the Chairman of Regal Partners Limited (Regal) without permission and photographed confidential takeover documents (‘Pitch Deck’). He then traded and procured others to trade in Platinum shares before leaking details of the takeover to the media, making over $300,000 profit for himself. The Federal Court in Sydney today sentenced Mr Forrest to five years imprisonment for insider trading and two years for procuring others to trade, with one year of the procuring offence to be served cumulatively with the insider trading offence. With a total sentence of six years and a non-parole period of three years, Mr Forrest will be eligible for parole on 22 January 2029. His Honour Justice Bromwich’s sentence also took into account a further offence that Mr Forrest provided unlicensed financial services as an investment funds manager to two entities over a 9-month period. This marks the first outcome for ASIC’s new specialist insider trading team which investigated and finalised the case within 16 months of the offending. The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP). ASIC’s market surveillance team detected Mr Forrest’s suspicious trading activity in September 2024 . ASIC’s insider trading team quickly launched an investigation, which led to a search warrant being executed on Mr Forrest’s home in November 2024 and charges being laid in August 2025. Prior to being charged, Mr Forrest adopted an agreed statement of facts for sentence and agreed to plead guilty at the first mention of the matter in the Downing Centre Local Court. Mr Forrest also agreed to forfeit the total realised profit from his insider trading of $309,571.84. The matter was committed for sentence to the Federal Court. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the prosecution of insider trading was an enduring priority for ASIC. ‘Mr Forrest’s actions were a brazen breach of trust and exploitation, and his imprisonment today reflects the seriousness of his crime. ‘While some insider trading cases can take several years, Mr Forrest went from crime to jail time in just over a year, underscoring ASIC’s determination to fast-track criminal cases of this type. ‘Insider trading is a zero-sum game. When somebody profits from inside information, everyone else loses, including every Australian with a superannuation or investment account. ‘ASIC will continue cracking down on insider trading and other misconduct that damages market integrity. ‘Australia is recognised globally for the integrity of its financial markets, and ASIC is determined to keep it that way.’ In delivering the sentence, His Honour Justice Robert Bromwich said, ‘This was serious and pernicious offending.’ ‘Mr Forrest ... obtained the Pitch Deck deliberately and dishonestly ... what then followed in relation to the use of that information was plainly premeditated, even if it cannot be known how far in advance. ‘Mr Forrest ... made a conscious choice to do something he knew was wrong, dishonest and illegal. ‘It was a profound breach of trust to obtain that information, and an even more profound breach of trust to use it for the purpose of illegal share trading. ‘The whole point of the insider trading prohibition is ... to maintain the integrity of the market by creating and maintaining a level information playing field,’ His Honour said. Since 2009, 46 people have been criminally convicted of insider trading following ASIC investigations, including senior executives and company chairs. The maximum penalty for the offence of insider trading is imprisonment for 15 years. Downloads Judgment Background In line with its 2025 enforcement priorities, ASIC established a dedicated insider trading team in late September 2024 to swiftly progress insider trading investigations and increase the number of criminal briefs referred to the CDPP. In July 2024, ASIC released Report 787 Review of Australian equity market cleanliness ( REP 787 ), which found that Australia’s equity markets continue to operate with a high level of integrity and remain consistently among the cleanest in the world. While the report confirmed strong overall market cleanliness, it did identify a temporary deterioration towards the end of 2023. During this period, an increase in media reports of deal information ahead of takeover, merger and capital-raising announcements suggested potential leaks of inside information, indicating a heightened risk of insider trading at such times. Management of inside information does not only matter to public companies. Industry participants involved in corporate transactions, including market intermediaries, corporate and professional advisers, fund managers and entities operating in private markets play a crucial role in supporting market cleanliness. These parties often have access to inside information and are responsible for maintaining confidentiality, supervising their representatives and handling that information with appropriate care. Rodney Forrest pleaded guilty to charges in August 2025 at the first mention of the matter in the Downing Centre Local Court, following a six-month investigation by ASIC’s insider trading team ( 25-163MR ). In the statement of agreed facts filed with the Court in August 2025, Mr Forrest admitted: that while in possession of the inside information he: Acquired around $2.69 million worth of Platinum shares between 29 August to 10 September 2024. Procured two individuals and an entity (for whom Forrest was the unlicensed investment manager) to also trade in Platinum shares between 6 September to 16 September 2024, in the case of the individuals by encouraging them to buy, and in the case of the entity, by operating its trading account to purchase Platinum shares totalling $457,000. Leaked the inside information to the media. Based on the statement of agreed facts filed with the Court, Mr Forrest admitted to the following chain of events: 4 January 2024 Mr Forrest began operating Sublime Asset Management (Sublime) without an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence, and entered into an investment manager agreement with Jatam Investments Pty Ltd (Jatam). 18 July 2024 Mr Forrest applied for an AFS licence for Sublime. August 2024 Sublime entered into an investment management agreement with the McKeage Cole Family Office, controlled by Regal Chairman, Michael Cole and his wife. 20 August 2024 Mr Forrest’s ASF licence application was rejected by ASIC, yet he continued to collect fees from Jatam and McKeage Cole Family Office for investment management services. 23 August 2024 While left unattended in Mr Cole’s office, Mr Forrest accessed Mr Cole’s computer and email account, and photographed a confidential pitch deck of Regal’s proposal to acquire Platinum. Mr Forrest’s use of Mr Cole’s computer and access to his email account on this occasion and for this purpose was unauthorised and without Mr Cole’s permission. 29 August – 10 September 2024 Mr Forrest purchased $2.69 million worth of Platinum shares for himself over eight days. 2 September 2024 Mr Forrest contacted a journalist to tell them about a “very solid” story, and indicated the need to show, not just tell, the information. 9 -13 September 2024 Mr Forrest procured two individuals to also buy Platinum shares. 10 September 2024 Mr Forrest made his final personal purchase of Platinum shares. On this day he also cropped photos taken from Mr Cole’s computer and explicitly shared inside information about Regal’s takeover bid with the journalist. 16 September 2024 before market close Mr Forrest purchased shares on behalf of Jatam in the last 10 minutes of trading, operating the entity’s share trading account. 16 September 2024 Media story on the takeover proposal was published after market close at 4:33pm. 17 September 2024 Prior to market opening, Platinum issued an ASX announcement confirming the takeover proposal, Platinum’s shares jumped by 12.5%. 18-20 September Mr Forrest sold all his Platinum shares, profiting $309,572. 23-24 September 2024 Mr Forrest sold Jatam’s shares by operating the entity’s share trading account, resulting in a $45,846 profit. 8 October 2024 Mr Forrest executed the last trade for Jatam under Sublime’s agreement with Jatam. 7 November 2024 ASIC executed a search warrant at Mr Forrest’s home residence, seizing his computer and his phone. On his phone, ASIC identified Mr Forrest’s communication with the journalist and the photos he took of Mr Cole’s computer screen displaying the confidential takeover documents containing inside information. Editor's note: The background of this media release was edited on 23 January 2026 to reflect Mr Forrest acquired $2.69 million of shares and address a transcription error.",

    "full_text": "Date 21 January 2026 Topics Mergers and acquisitions Petrol and fuel The ACCC has decided that Ampol Retail Holding Pty Ltd’s (ASX:ALD) acquisition of EG Group Australia and EG AsiaPac Holdings (together, EG Australia) requires further in-depth assessment by the ACCC. This means the ACCC has not approved the acquisition in its Phase 1 assessment and the transaction will move to a Phase 2 review. Ampol and EG Australia both retail fuel, including petrol and diesel, and convenience products in all Australian states and territories. The ACCC is satisfied that the acquisition could substantially lessen competition in the retail supply of petrol and diesel in several markets in Australia. “The acquisition would combine two major fuel retailers in Australia,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said. “We have identified 115 EG sites where the acquisition could substantially lessen competition in the relevant local market, and also consider that the acquisition could substantially lessen competition in the metropolitan areas of Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.” Ampol’s offer to divest 19 retail fuel sites does not adequately address these local or metropolitan wide issues which is why we have decided to conduct a further in-depth competition assessment. The ACCC has not reached a conclusion on the issues and will continue to consider the acquisition in Phase 2. The ACCC invites submissions in response to its Phase 2 Notice by 4 February 2026. Parties can contact the ACCC via mergers@accc.gov.au . This is the first assessment to be subject to a Phase 2 review under the new merger control regime, which became mandatory on 1 January 2026. More information and the Phase 2 Notice will be available on the ACCC’s acquisitions register today here: Ampol – EG Australia. Background Merger control regime From 1 January 2026, it is mandatory for businesses to notify the ACCC of any acquisition that meets the notification thresholds set by the Minister. They must wait for ACCC approval before they can proceed. Once notified, the notification is listed on the ACCC’s Acquisitions Register and stakeholder consultation is invited. The ACCC is required to make a decision in 15 to 30 business days in its Phase 1 assessment, subject to any extensions, to either approve the acquisition or refer it to a Phase 2 review. The ACCC can decide a notification is to be subject to a Phase 2 review if the ACCC is satisfied that the acquisition to which the notification relates, if put into effect, could, in all of the circumstances, have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in any market. Under the Competition and Consumer Act, a Phase 2 assessment can take up to 90 business days, unless extended under specific circumstances.

    "summary": "",
    "source": "ASIC Media Releases",
    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC has secured the return of nearly $40 million to more than 38,000 retail investors and driven substantial compliance improvement across Australia’s contracts for difference (CFD) sector following a whole of industry review. CFDs allow investors to speculate on the price movements of assets such as shares, currencies or commodities, without owning them. Between October 2024 and December 2025, ASIC reviewed 52 licensed CFD issuers, requiring them to show how they were distributing their high-risk products. In the report, Risky business: Driving change in CFD issuers’ distribution practices ( REP 828 ), ASIC found widespread weaknesses in how CFD issuers complied with their design and distribution obligations (DDO), ASIC’s CFD product intervention order (PIO) and regulatory reporting requirements. ASIC found that more than half the CFD sector had contravened the PIO by offering ‘margin discounts’ to retail clients who took on opposing long and short positions. These investors incurred higher funding costs but could not profit from their opposing CFD positions. ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, ‘Each year, thousands of Australians lose money trading CFDs and through our review we have helped put $40 million back in the pockets of more than 38,000 investors. ‘These are complex, high-risk products, where most investors face losses, and even profitable trades can be entirely eroded by trading costs.’ Driving improvement in distribution and compliance practices ‘ASIC’s direct intervention has driven widespread improvements in CFD issuers’ target market determinations, client onboarding questionnaires, reporting compliance and monitoring of client trading outcomes,’ Ms Constant said. Key changes in CFD issuers’ distribution practices and compliance arrangements achieved in ASIC’s review include: 39 issuers made changes to their target markets 46 issuers improved website content, with one issuer amending almost 1,000 webpages 44 issuers improved their client onboarding questionnaires, with many issuers making substantial changes 42 issuers implemented new processes for ongoing monitoring of client trading outcomes and behaviours, or made significant improvements to existing processes 48 issuers implemented changes to comply with their over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transaction reporting requirements, after the review identified over 70 million erroneous reports Reportable situations lodged by issuers increased by 127% compared to the previous year, reflecting greater compliance awareness and responsiveness. Ms Constant said, ‘While the CFD industry has made important changes, there’s still work to do. Issuers must continually monitor, adapt, and strengthen their compliance practices, and we urge Australians to pay close attention to what they are being offered. ‘ASIC will continue to act decisively, and where appropriate, will take further action to address misconduct and reduce consumer harm.’ Driving better outcomes for consumers of financial products and services, including high-risk products, such as CFDs, is one of ASIC’s 2025-26 priorities for supervising market intermediaries . Downloads Report 828: Risky business: Driving change in CFD issuers’ distribution practices (REP 828) Background CFDs are complex, leveraged, over-the-counter (OTC) products that can expose retail investors to significant losses. They allow clients to speculate on the change in value of assets like shares, currencies and commodities. Leverage and associated financing fees can magnify investor losses. A small price change against a leveraged CFD position can have a big effect on trading returns or losses, even loss of the entire investment. In the 2024 financial year alone, 68% of retail CFD investors lost money, totalling more than $458 million, including $73 million in fees. ASIC’s Moneysmart website has further information about CFDs and forex trading . The DDO, which commenced in October 2021, are intended to help consumers obtain appropriate financial products by requiring issuers and distributors to have a consumer-centric approach to the design and distribution of products. ASIC’s review built on two earlier reviews undertaken between 2022 and 2024 of CFDs issuers’ distribution practices and reports setting out better practices for meeting their obligations and areas for improvement: Report 770 Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives ( REP 770 ) Report 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligations ( REP 795 ). During its review, on 5 December 2025, ASIC also issued an interim stop order against Stratos Trading Pty Limited (trading as FXCM) after it failed to respond to ASIC’s concerns regarding deficiencies in its target market determination ( 25-295MR ). The stop order was revoked after FXCM amended its target market determination to address ASIC’s concerns. On 3 November 2023, ASIC commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against online investment platform, eToro Aus Capital Limited (eToro), regarding its CFD product in the regulator’s first design and distribution action ( 23-204MR ). ASIC’s product intervention order (PIO) The PIO on CFDs came into effect in 2021 and has been effective in reducing the risk of significant detriment to retail clients resulting from CFDs ( 22-082MR ). ASIC’s CFD product intervention order will expire on 23 May 2027, unless it is remade. In 2026, ASIC will engage with industry on our proposed way forward.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) has set aside a decision of the registered liquidator disciplinary committee (the committee) to cancel the liquidator registration of Richard Ernest Auricht. The ART decided Richard Ernest Auricht’s registration should instead be suspended for five years commencing on 23 June 2023, which was the date of the committee’s original decision. Mr Auricht originally had his registration cancelled by the committee as a result of drawing remuneration without creditor or court approval, failing to lodge documents with ASIC, and not having the experience, knowledge and abilities to act as a liquidator. In handing down its decision, the ART agreed that Mr Auricht drew remuneration without approval and failed to comply with his reporting obligations to ASIC. The ART also found Mr Auricht lacked capacity to perform satisfactorily the functions and duties of a liquidator. The ART found that Mr Auricht's subsequent seeking of court approval for remuneration did not remedy the fact he drew remuneration without a determination. It also rejected his argument that ASIC should have intervened when he sought court approval for remuneration before it referred him for disciplinary action, noting that ASIC has 'no obligation to participate in the Supreme Court fee approval application.' However, the ART considered that a five-year suspension was a more appropriate outcome, as Mr Auricht’s conduct did not involve dishonesty and he had not previously been subject to disciplinary action. ASIC has given effect to the ART’s decision by suspending Mr Auricht’s registration as a liquidator. View the ART’s decision on the Registered liquidator disciplinary decisions webpage. Background On 28 June 2023, a liquidator disciplinary committee decided that Richard Ernst Auricht’s registration as a liquidator should be cancelled (23-187MR) . ASIC’s referral to the Committee alleged Mr Auricht was not a fit and proper person to be registered as a liquidator, as he had failed to carry out adequately and properly his duties as a liquidator by drawing remuneration without creditor or court approval, was not lodging documents with ASIC, and no longer had the required qualifications, experience, knowledge and abilities.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The husband-and-wife directors behind a group of collapsed agriculture businesses linked to a NSW corruption scandal have both been disqualified by ASIC from managing corporations for the maximum period of five years. Jimmy Yang (also known as Jimmy Liu) and his wife Freda Feng were the directors of three failed companies in the agriculture sector: UWE Hay Pty Ltd ACN 600 930 881 (UWE Hay) ACN 060 242 515 ACN 060 242 515 (United World Enterprises), and UWE - Griffith Property Pty Ltd ACN 600 931 833 (Griffith). Mr Yang was a director of these companies between 2004 and 2025, and Mrs Feng was a director between 2004 and 2023. Mr Yang was also a director of the business and personal services company SMU Holdings Pty Ltd (ACN 604 111 622) between 2004 and 2025. ASIC found that Mr Yang and Ms Feng each failed to act properly and meet their obligations as company officers, including when Mr Feng improperly used UWE Hay’s funds and his position as a director of UWE Hay to offer incentives to former NSW MP for Wagga Wagga Daryl Maguire. ASIC also found that Mr Yang and Ms Feng: Failed to ensure UWE Hay, United World Enterprises, Griffth and SMU Holdings complied with their statutory obligations to the Australian Taxation Office Failed to maintain and keep adequate books and records for UWE Hay and United World Enterprises Improperly used their position to withdraw company funds from UWE Hay’s bank accounts without explanation for the use of the funds Improperly used their positions by permitting loans to be made from UWE Hay and United World Enterprises to other entities Improperly used their positions to allow United World Enterprises to enter into an agreement to sponsor a work visa in exchange for United World Enterprises receiving a financial loan Improperly used their positions to sell a vehicle owned by United World Enterprises and use the proceeds to purchase a new vehicle for UWE Hay, and Failed to prevent UWE Hay and United World Enterprises from insolvent trading. At the time of ASIC’s decision, the four companies owed a combined total of $56,830,527.44 to unsecured creditors. This included $110,862.60 owed to the ATO, $6,501.49 owing for employee entitlements, $2,229.80 owing for workers compensation and significant debts owed to small businesses in the agricultural industry. In disqualifying Mr Feng and Ms Yang, ASIC relied on supplementary reports lodged by liquidator Jamieson Louttit of JLA Insolvency and Advisory and Liam Bailey of O’Brien Palmer. ASIC assisted to prepare the statutory reports by providing funding from the Assetless Administration Fund. Mr Yang and Ms Feng are both disqualified from managing corporations until 17 December 2030. They have the right to seek a review of ASIC’s decision by the Administrative Review Tribunal. Background Section 206F of the Corporations Act allows ASIC to disqualify a person from managing corporations for a maximum period of five years if, within a seven year period, the person was an officer of two or more companies, and those companies were wound up and a liquidator provides a report to ASIC about each of the company’s inability to pay its debts. Through enforcement action against selected directors who contravene s206F, ASIC demonstrates that there are appropriate consequences for the mismanagement of small and large companies. ASIC continues to take targeted action against individual directors to protect the wider public, employees and other businesses against the future mismanagement of companies. ASIC maintains a banned and disqualified persons register that provides information about people who have been disqualified from: involvement in the management of a corporation auditing self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs), or practising in the financial services or credit industry.",

    "full_text": "Date 5 January 2026 Topics Mergers and acquisitions The ACCC accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from WiseTech Global (ASX: WTC) and its subsidiary BluJay Solutions (Australia) Pty Ltd on 30 December 2025 to divest Expedient, a logistics software business, following an ACCC investigation. WiseTech acquired Expedient as part of its acquisition of e2open Parent Holdings, Inc. which completed in August 2025. “ While WiseTech informed the ACCC about the acquisition, Wisetech completed the acquisition before the ACCC conducted its review and could reach a decision , despite being aware of the significant concerns being raised,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. Following completion of the acquisition, the ACCC commenced an enforcement investigation to assess whether it would have the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition, in breach of the merger law. The undertaking addresses the competition concerns identified by the ACCC in its investigation, by restoring Expedient as an independent competitor to WiseTech. The undertaking is court enforceable and imposes strict requirements on WiseTech regarding the divestiture of Expedient. Expedient will be sold to a purchaser approved by the ACCC on the basis that the purchaser will be able to operate the Expedient business as a viable competitor to WiseTech in the supply of logistics software in Australia. WiseTech is Australia’s largest supplier of cloud-based enterprise application software to the global logistics industry with its core software offering, CargoWise. BluJay was part of the e2open group, and acquired Expedient in March 2020. Expedient supplies logistics software services, and was a competitor to WiseTech’s CargoWise in Australia and New Zealand prior to the acquisition. “The ACCC considers that WiseTech already has substantial market power in the supply of logistics software, and the acquisition has the effect of removing the competition between CargoWise and Expedient and significantly reduced the choice available to Australian customers,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “The ACCC received significant concerns from users of logistics software during the investigation, and was concerned that the acquisition could lead to higher prices or lower quality services.” “Prior to the new merger regime coming into effect on 1 January 2026, there was no requirement for a merger party to obtain ACCC clearance before proceeding to complete an acquisition. This was one of the key concerns with the previous informal regime,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “However, under the new merger regime which commenced on 1 January 2026, merger parties are required to notify the ACCC of any acquisition that meets the thresholds and must not complete the acquisition until it has been approved by the ACCC or the Australian Competition Tribunal .” In circumstances where an acquisition is not required to be notified but raises competition concerns, the ACCC may still investigate whether the acquisition is likely to substantially lessen competition in breach of section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. “We retain the ability to investigate acquisitions below the notification thresholds under the substantial lessening of competition test,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “We can also investigate where an acquisition that is required to be notified has been completed without obtaining ACCC or Tribunal clearance, as this would be in breach of the new merger laws and expose the acquisition to being automatically void.” “The ACCC encourages merger parties to engage with the ACCC in relation to all acquisitions which raise potential competition concerns to manage this risk,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. Further information, including the undertakings accepted by the ACCC, will be published on the ACCC’s undertakings register in due course . Background WiseTech is a publicly listed Australian technology company whose group of companies makes available cloud-based enterprise application software to the global logistics industry, including its core software offering CargoWise. e2open is a technology company providing connected supply chain software platforms, headquartered in Addison, Texas. Expedient is a subsidiary of BluJay, and supplies logistics software services principally in relation to Australia and New Zealand. e2open acquired BluJay in May 2021. The Acquisition On 26 May 2025, WiseTech entered into a binding agreement and plan of merger to acquire e2open. Completion of the acquisition occurred on 4 August 2025. As a result of the acquisition, Expedient became an indirect subsidiary of WiseTech. The Investigation The ACCC was concerned that WiseTech, which is the largest supplier of logistics software, acquiring Expedient, combined two significant suppliers of logistics software in Australia with specific customs clearance capability. The ACCC considers that WiseTech already has substantial market power, and that the Acquisition removed the constraint CargoWise and Expedient provided on each other and significantly reduced the choice available to Australian customers. The ACCC was concerned that, in the absence of the undertaking to divest Expedient, WiseTech could increase prices and or reduce the service quality of its logistics software services. Logistics software is used by freight forwarders, customs brokers and beneficial cargo owners to assist in the export and import of goods in Australia, and therefore, has a wide impact on Australian businesses and consumers. The Undertaking The Undertaking requires BluJay to divest Expedient to an ACCC approved purchaser (and WiseTech to procure that it does so) and includes supporting arrangements to monitor compliance. It is a court enforceable undertaking given under section 87B of the Competition and Consumer Act. By accepting the section 87B undertaking, the ACCC considers its enforcement investigation is resolved, as the undertaking will ensure that Expedient is sold, resulting in the creation or strengthening of a viable, effective, independent and long-term competitor to WiseTech.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA imposes additional licence conditions on Diversa Trustees Limited Tuesday 23 December 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has imposed additional licence conditions on Diversa Trustees Limited (Diversa) to address prudential concerns relating to its investment governance frameworks and practices, including oversight of platform investment options made available to members. Diversa acts as trustee for 10 registrable superannuation entities and has approximately 291,000 member accounts and over $15 billion in funds under management. The additional licence conditions follow APRA’s recent thematic review of the investment governance, strategic planning and member outcomes practices of superannuation trustees that offer platforms (Platform Trustees). Broadly, the review identified deficiencies in Diversa’s onboarding processes and practices, investment option monitoring and reporting, and management of conflicts of interest. Specifically, APRA’s review of Diversa identified concerns regarding the: onboarding of new investment options, including the lack of sufficiently rigorous, well-defined and consistently applied investment selection criteria; adequacy of operational due diligence undertaken in relation to new investment options; and adequacy of Diversa’s investment monitoring and reporting framework. APRA requires assurance, with appropriate oversight by an independent expert, that Diversa’s investment governance framework and practices are fit for purpose in their design and operation. Under the additional licence conditions, effective 23 December 2025, Diversa is required to: appoint an independent expert to undertake separate reviews of its platforms’ investment menus and investment governance framework; develop and implement an uplift plan to address identified gaps, and provide APRA with assurance or attestation that the remediation actions are complete and effective; and undertake a further review of its investment menus against the enhanced investment governance requirements to determine ongoing suitability of certain investment options. Diversa must also refrain from onboarding new high-risk investment options to its platform without first following an enhanced due diligence process, with oversight by the independent expert, and having an accountable person attest that the onboarding of the investment option is in members’ best financial interests. These actions build on APRA’s public letter of 7 October 2025 , which indicated that APRA would escalate supervisory intensity as necessary to ensure that appropriate steps are being taken by Platform Trustees to lift investment governance and member outcomes practices. Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said: “APRA has made clear our expectations around effective investment governance frameworks and practices, including in relation to onboarding and monitoring of investment options, to ensure they are in members’ best financial interests. Trustees play an important role curating the investment options made available to members and their decisions should be underpinned by robust governance.\" APRA will continue to coordinate closely with ASIC on the regulatory response to weaknesses identified with Platform Trustees.

It occurs when suppliers: make it known they will not supply goods or services unless a reseller agrees not to advertise or sell at a price below a specified minimum price; induce, or attempt to induce, resellers not to advertise or sell below a specified minimum price; enter into agreements, or offer to enter into agreements, for the supply of goods or services on terms including that the reseller must not advertise or sell below a specified minimum price; withhold supply of goods or services because a reseller, or a purchaser from the reseller, has not agreed not to advertise or sell below a specified minimum price, or has advertised or sold (or is likely to sell) at a price below a specified minimum price; use, in relation to goods or services supplied or that may be supplied, a statement as to price which is likely to be understood as the price below which the goods or services are not to be sold. Businesses may lodge a notification of resale price maintenance conduct with the ACCC or apply for ACCC authorisation of proposed resale price maintenance conduct, which will be permitted if the likely public benefit from the proposed conduct outweighs the likely detriment from that conduct. More information about resale price maintenance can be found at Minimum resale prices . Addressing anti-competitive agreements and practices is an enduring compliance and enforcement priority for the ACCC. More information about the ACCC’s use of section 87B undertakings is available in the Guidelines on ACCC approach to court enforceable undertakings .

City Beach admitted that, between June 2022 and October 2024, it had supplied products that that did not comply with the button battery safety standard on more than 54,000 occasions, and that during the same period it had supplied products that did not comply with the button battery information standard on more than 56,000 occasions. The products included toys, digital notepads, keyrings, lights and light-up Jibbitz accessories for Crocs shoes. The Court noted that many of these products were marketed or intended for children. The Court observed that there were pervasive failures by City Beach to inform itself of its obligations under the Australian Consumer Law and to comply with its obligations as a retailer of products which may cause serious harm, and that City Beach’s unlawful conduct put more than 50,000 young children at risk of severe injury or death. The Court described City Beach’s “lack of urgency in seeking to recall the non-compliant products” as “condemnable.” “Today’s penalty sends clear message to businesses and suppliers that failing to meet safety standards for button batteries is unacceptable and can result in serious penalties,” ACCC Commissioner Luke Woodward said. “Button batteries pose a significant risk to children, and can be fatal. The ACCC will not hesitate to take strong enforcement action against businesses that fail to comply with the button battery standards.” This was the first court proceeding brought by the ACCC for breaches of the button battery safety standards. Earlier this month, the Court found City Beach breached the Australian Consumer Law by selling a range of consumer novelty products that did not comply with mandatory button battery safety and information standards. The Court ordered an injunction restraining City Beach from engaging in future contraventions of the Mandatory Standards. The Court also ordered City Beach to implement a consumer law compliance program and to undertake advertising as part of its voluntary recall of the products in question. Following a contested hearing on penalties, today the Court ordered City Beach to pay penalties totalling $14 million. To check if a product has been recalled, visit the ACCC product safety website or contact City Beach . Examples of the recalled products subject to the court proceedings Background The ACCC commenced Federal Court proceedings against City Beach in April 2025. City Beach is a national retailer primarily offering surf and skate consumer goods including clothing, accessories and novelty items. Button batteries are dangerous and pose a significant risk to young children if swallowed or inserted. If swallowed, a button battery can become stuck in a child’s throat and result in serious lifelong injuries or death. Insertion into body parts such as the ears or nose can also lead to serious injuries. In Australia, three children have died from inserting or ingesting button batteries. Children up to 5 years of age are at greatest risk of injury from button batteries. Australia’s mandatory button battery standards , which came into effect in June 2022, aim to reduce the risk of death or serious injury caused by button batteries. The safety standard requires products to have secure battery compartments that are designed to be resistant to being opened by children.

    "full_text": "Date 22 December 2025 Topics Energy Overall gas supply on Australia’s east coast is expected to be sufficient in the second quarter of 2026; however, the southern states (Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory) will collectively rely on surplus gas from Queensland and gas stores to meet demand, the ACCC’s latest gas inquiry report reveals. The latest forecasts from gas producers suggest a range between a 15 petajoule (PJ) surplus and an 8 PJ shortfall for the east coast gas market in the second quarter of 2026, depending on the amount of uncontracted gas exported by the Queensland-based LNG producers. Queensland is anticipated to have sufficient gas to meet local needs, while the southern states are projected to need an additional 26 PJ of gas through the quarter. “The gap between gas demand and supply from southern gas sources leading into and through winter has widened in recent years, largely due to reduced production from legacy gas fields and increased demand for gas-powered electricity generation,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said. “Some of Queensland’s surplus gas will need to be transported to the southern states to help fill the forecast supply gap in the second quarter of 2026.” As at Monday 22 December, Victoria’s Iona gas storage facility was estimated to require about 12 PJ of gas injections before May 2026 to replenish gas stores ahead of the 2026 winter period. The quarterly supply-demand outlook for Australia’s southern states (2026) Source: ACCC analysis of data obtained from gas producers in October 2025 and of the domestic demand forecast (Step Change scenario) from AEMO, Gas Statement of Opportunities (GSOO), March 2025 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. The quantity required to meet long-term LNG SPAs includes feed gas requirements (such as fuel) required to produce LNG. Recent prices are within expected ranges Contracted gas prices have been steady at around $13-15 per gigajoule (GJ) since falling from the very high levels seen during 2022-23. The prices are within expected ranges given expectations of LNG netback prices and domestic supply and demand conditions. Prices offered by gas producers to retailers for 2026 supply fell 3 per cent to $13.56 per GJ in the first half of 2025. Prices offered by gas retailers to commercial and industrial users fell 5 per cent to $14.43 per GJ. While prices appear to be relatively stable, more gas is being contracted on a short-term basis than in previous years. The volume of gas sold under short-term contracts increased by 78 per cent to 57 PJ in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. “We’ve heard from a range of commercial and industrial gas users that, while prices have stabilised, current price levels continue to pose challenges to the viability of their businesses,” Ms Brakey said. “These challenges are exacerbated by difficulties in obtaining long-term agreements for gas supply. Short-term contracts do not provide the cost predictability and supply certainty that longer-term contracts provide.” The ACCC has also continued to hear concerns from commercial and industrial gas users about the inflexibility of the expression of interest processes under the Gas Market Code. Gas users remain concerned about a lack of competition between gas suppliers, though some users told the ACCC they had observed recent improvements. Gas costs of production The ACCC has released with today’s report advice from an independent research firm on long-run gas production costs in the east coast gas market. Gas production costs can influence the prices producers are willing to accept for supply as well as longer-term investment decisions. One of its key observations is that, in the absence of new sources of gas supply, production costs are expected to rise over time as lower cost reserves are depleted. The ACCC welcomes feedback on this accompanying report. LNG netback price series review The ACCC has commenced a review of the methodology for calculating LNG netback prices to ensure that this price series remains an accurate resource for market participants on price benchmarks relevant to Australia’s east coast gas market. The ACCC has set out issues relevant to the review in the December 2025 gas inquiry report and invites submissions from stakeholders by 6 February 2026. Retailer best practice selling guidance The ACCC has developed draft voluntary best practice retailer selling guidance for comment. The draft guidance follows the ACCC’s Retailer Behaviour Review last year, which found that some retailers’ selling practices persistently fell short of what would be expected in a well-functioning retail market. The draft guidance is published in the December 2025 gas inquiry report and is open for comment until 27 February 2026. Background Australia’s east coast gas market is an interconnected grid joining Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT. The Northern Territory and Western Australia are separate gas regions. In 2025, the Australian Treasurer directed the ACCC to hold an inquiry into the market for the supply of natural gas in Australia. This direction provided that the ACCC would continue its inquiry into the gas market, which first commenced in 2017. The new direction requires the ACCC to conduct the inquiry until 30 June 2030. The ACCC’s inquiry examines the wholesale gas market, primarily gas sold by producers to large gas buyers, including commercial and industrial gas users and gas retailers. The ACCC’s next interim gas inquiry report is scheduled for March 2026.

BDO Audit was the audit company for ASX-listed tech company Dubber Corporation Limited (Dubber), the holding company of a group of companies (Dubber Group) including Dubber Pty Ltd. Mr Just was the lead auditor at the time of the alleged contraventions. ASIC alleges BDO Audit and Mr Just failed to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the audit reports lodged with ASIC for the financial years ending 30 June 2020 to 30 June 2022 were not materially false or misleading because of statements made in each of the reports that: In BDO’s opinion, the financial report gave a true and fair view of Dubber Group’s financial position BDO had conducted the audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, and BDO believed the audit evidence obtained was sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for that opinion. This in circumstances where ASIC alleges, amongst other matters, that Dubber’s financial reports for each of the relevant financial years were materially misstated and the audits had not been conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘We consider BDO Audit and Mr Just acted outside of the auditing standards, and we allege misleading reports were submitted to ASIC. ‘Auditor misconduct continues to be a key enforcement priority for ASIC. ‘Confidence and trust are fundamental to the role of company auditors, and critical to maintaining the integrity of our markets and enabling investors to make informed decisions,’ the Deputy Chair said. Downloads Concise Statement Originating Process Background On 1 March 2024, Dubber released an announcement to the ASX that as part of the audit review process for its 31 December 2023 half-year accounts, the Company had become aware of inconsistencies in respect of funds that had been held on behalf of the Company by a third-party trustee. A preliminary investigation by the Company had uncovered that funds, purported to have been held in a term deposit account, may have been applied for other purposes and were not currently available to the Company. The Company’s maximum exposure was stated to be $26.6 million. On 9 April 2024, in a further announcement to the ASX, Dubber announced that from the investigation it had conducted to that date, it was alleged that Dubber’s then CEO and the third party trustee were likely involved in the unauthorised use of those funds. On 17 June 2025, in a further announcement to the ASX, Dubber announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Dubber Pty Ltd, had commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against its former auditors, BDO Audit (WA) Pty Ltd. The claim was for an amount of up to $26,605,000 plus interest and costs.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email So called ‘pump and dump’ operators – unscrupulous actors who start rumours about small cap securities to inflate the share price in the hope of making a quick profit, are increasingly targeting Australian investors ahead of the holiday period, with a notable rise in reports to the regulator. ASIC is warning the public to be vigilant about widespread, coordinated pump and dump schemes targeting retail investors, including Australians trading in overseas markets, who can be tricked into buying thinly traded overseas stocks that ae then rapidly sold down by the promoters once the price has been inflated. ASIC has also observed scammers fraudulently using the identity of Australian celebrities to lure victims into messaging apps like WhatsApp where they are directed to buy shares. This warning comes as four people involved in a coordinated scheme to pump up Australian share prices, before dumping them at inflated prices were sentenced today in Downing Street Court . Pump and dump uplift seen by international regulators The rise of pump and dump schemes was a hot topic of discussion among a meeting of key financial regulators from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America in London last month, with ASIC’s Amanda Zeller, Senior Executive Leader, Market Integrity, noting that the types of schemes were becoming increasingly sophisticated, with criminal gangs increasingly engaged in the activity. Among the techniques observed have been cybercriminals hacking brokerage accounts to conduct trades, exploitation of differing regulatory regimes in cross border trades, and luring in prospective traders via ad targeting on social media. Regulators, including New Zealand’s Financial Market Authority and the United States’ Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have issued official warnings recently. ‘Pump and dump operators zero in on small cap stocks with low liquidity, which means when misleading announcement or rumour is made, it has an outsized impact on the share price,’ Ms Zeller said. ‘That then draws in traders who watch for momentum in small cap stocks, who then pile in to ride the increase. Unfortunately, those are the ones left with the losses after the pump instigators have bolted.’ ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, ‘Pump and dump schemes are a serious threat to market integrity and investor confidence. They can also result in unsuspecting investors losing money. ASIC will continue to work with international regulators and take enforcement action where appropriate. ‘This is a global issue requiring regulators connecting to tackle this harmful practice. ‘ASIC is keeping a close eye on small-cap trading activity through its sophisticated real-time surveillance system and by integrating trade data with surveillance of social media and online forums, such as on X, WhatsApp, HotCopper, Reddit, Discord. ‘ASIC takes market manipulation very seriously and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action where appropriate.’ Background On 10 June 2025 four people involved in a coordinated scheme to pump up Australian share prices before dumping them at inflated prices plead guilty to multiple criminal charges ( 25-098MR ). New Zealand’s Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has also issued a public warning about suspected pump and dump schemes affecting small-cap stocks listed on US exchanges. The United States’ Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has also issued an investor alert for pump and dump scams . FINRA noted significant spike in investor complaints resulting from recommendations made by fraudulent ‘investment groups’ promoted through social media channels. In July 2025, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a Public Service Announcement noting there had been a 300 per cent rise in victim complaints about pump and dump scams in the last year. These scams related to both stocks and crypto assets. In 2022, an ASIC report estimated that retail investors exiting risk, over potentially pumped events, incurred loss of $6.3 million per month. Moneysmart guidance on spotting a pump and dump scam The underlying tactics for a pump and dump scheme are like investment scams more broadly. Watch out for: Paid advertising. Spruikers might pay big money for advertisements to appear high in online search results. They also advertise through social media. A rush of finfluencer endorsements. Unscrupulous finfluencers may start spreading misleading or plain wrong information about a particular investment, maybe citing inside information. The coordinated activity can make it seem like investor hype. Social media ads directing investors to private chats where particular stocks are recommended Fake celebrity endorsements. Scammers will use images of well known identities in their marketing material, or the creation of fake social media profiles, to give credibility to their message. It is very unlikely that a well-known personality would be recommending investments in individual companies or crypto assets. Unsolicited marketing . You might receive an unsolicited email or phone call. Be wary of anyone spruiking the attractiveness of a specific investment and creating a sense of urgency. Forum comments. There might be a rush of commentary about a particular little-known investment across multiple online forums. Strange market behaviour. You might see a sudden price increase or spike in an investment that is new or not usually volatile. Overall, the objective is to create in you a sense of urgency, a feeling of having special inside information, and a fear of missing a great thing. How to protect your money Pump and dump schemes can look very convincing. So, before you invest your money, check basic facts about what you’re investing in and who with. Follow our stop, check and protect tips at check before you invest . If you suspect a pump and dump scheme, act quickly to report it to SCAMwatch at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the ATO or ReportCyber .",

The four ringleaders of the ‘pump and dump’ scheme pleaded guilty in June 2025 to conspiracy to commit market rigging and dealing with the proceeds of crime ( 25-098MR ). Larisa Quinlan was sentenced to an ICO for 1 year and 9 months. Ms Quinlan must additionally serve 160 hours of community service and comply with other strict additional conditions. She must also pay a fine of $8,015. Kurt Stuart was sentenced to an ICO for 2 years and in addition, must serve 200 hours of community service and comply with other strict additional conditions. He must pay a $22,270.11 fine. Emma Summer was sentenced to an ICO for 1 year and 10 months, must serve 160 hours of community service and comply with other strict additional conditions. She must pay a $16,029.50 fine. Syed Yusef was sentenced to an ICO for 14 months, must serve 120 hours of community service and comply with other strict additional conditions. Additionally, the Court made a pecuniary penalty order under s 116 of the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 (Cth) for Mr Yusuf to pay $13,464.89 to the Commonwealth of Australia. All offenders must comply with the standard ICO conditions that they must not commit any offence and must submit to supervision by a community corrections officer. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, ‘Pump and dump trading isn’t just illegal, it damages trust in our financial markets, and people lose hard-earned money. ‘This group used social media to rig the market, artificially pump-up penny stocks, then dump them for quick profits - leaving everyday investors to wear the losses. ‘ASIC pursued this crime against the market to hold this group accountable, and to protect consumers from future schemes. ‘It is an ongoing priority for ASIC to target activity that undermines market integrity. We will continue to take decisive action against those who attempt to manipulate the market, and we urge all investors to report any suspicious activity.’ In delivering the sentencing judgment, Her Honour Judge Turner emphasised that duration is not the most significant feature of the offending, the criminality is essentially in the agreement to participate in criminal activity. Her Honour also found each of the offenders were active participants in the conspiracy and motivated by financial gain. This matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP) following a referral from ASIC. Downloads ASIC assets from messaging the public Telegram group chats. (Click to enlarge) Background Market rigging is the illegal practice of intentionally manipulating the supply or demand of a financial product – like shares – to artificially push its price up or down. It involves creating a false or misleading impression of market activity, often through techniques like spreading false information, executing misleading trades, or colluding with others to fix prices or divide markets. Market rigging is considered a form of market manipulation and is treated as a white-collar crime under Australian law. Conspiracy to commit market rigging is an offence against s11.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and s1041B(1)(b) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). ASIC monitors trading on Australian licensed markets through its sophisticated real-time surveillance system and by integrating trade data with data from third parties to monitor pump and dump activity in Australian securities markets. This enables ASIC to see underlying clients, to identify networks of connected parties and to analyse trading patterns. On 23 July 2024, charges were laid against the four defendants ( 24-161MR ). On 10 June 2025, the four defendants pleaded guilty to the charges ( 25-098MR ). Mr Stuart and Ms Summer each pleaded guilty to one count of dealing with money or other property that was, and that they believed to be, proceeds of crime to the value of $10,000 or more. Ms Quinlan and Mr Yusuf each pleaded guilty to one count of dealing with money or other property that was, and that they believed to be, proceeds of crime to the value of $1,000 or more. Mr Yusuf also pleaded guilty to one count of dealing with money or other property that was proceeds of crime, reckless to that, to the value of $10,000 or more. ASIC took a range of measures to support market integrity during the 2020-21 pandemic, including issuing public warnings about social media-led ‘pump and dump’ campaigns and posting directly on social media forums to warn members their actions may be in breach of the law ( 21-256MR ). In October 2023, ASIC warned investors ‘don’t get burned by hype’ in a series of advertisements run in cinemas before each screening of the film Dumb Money , which depicted the millions of retail investors who started buying shares in US company GameStop, causing share prices to surge from US$20 to US$500 in a few short weeks ( Dumb Money: Don’t believe the hype ).",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The Federal Court has ordered Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) pay $250 million in penalties for widespread misconduct and systemic risk failures affecting the Australian Government, taxpayers and at least 65,000 retail bank customers. These are the largest combined penalties ASIC has ever secured against a single entity. His Honour Justice Jonathan Beach increased the penalty for ANZ’s inaccurate reporting of secondary bond market turnover data by $10 million, bringing the penalty in relation to that misconduct to $50 million. The outcome is in relation to four separate court proceedings spanning misconduct across ANZ’s Institutional and Retail divisions, announced in September 2025 ( 25-201MR ). His Honour Justice Jonathan Beach today ordered ANZ pay: $135 million in combined penalties for institutional and markets misconduct relating to the management of a $14 billion government bond deal and inaccurate reporting of secondary bond market turnover data to the Australian Government. This includes a record $80 million penalty for unconscionable conduct, $40 million for failing to respond to hundreds of customer hardship notices, in some cases for more than two years, and failing to have proper hardship processes in place, $40 million for making false and misleading statements about savings interest rates, and failing to pay the promised interest rate to tens of thousands of customers, and $35 million for failing to refund fees charged to thousands of dead customers and not responding to loved ones trying to deal with deceased estates inside the required timeframe. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, ‘ANZ is a critical part of Australia’s banking system and, frankly, they must do better. ‘The size of the penalties ordered today underscores the seriousness of ANZ’s misconduct and its far-reaching consequences for the Government, taxpayers and tens of thousands of customers. ‘ANZ must overhaul its non-financial risk management and put the interests of clients, customers and the public first. ‘In the bond trading and misreporting matter, ANZ exposed the Australian Government to a significant risk of harm, denied the Government an opportunity to protect itself and the public interest, and mislead the government for nearly two years by overstating bond trading volumes by billions of dollars. ‘ASIC estimates ANZ’s trading misconduct cost up to $26 million, reducing funds that could have supported essential public services.’ ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘Tens of thousands of customers suffered from systemic failures across ANZ’s retail bank, which extended to fundamental banking basics like paying the correct interest rate on savings accounts. ‘ANZ will also pay for misconduct that made an already difficult time far harder for hundreds of its customers who were experiencing hardship or dealing with the loss of a loved one. 'This outcome sends a clear message to ANZ that it needs to do better by its customers and to all banks that the cost of breaking the law is not an acceptable cost of doing business,’ the Deputy Chair said. In relation to misconduct relating to the management of the $14 billion government bond deal , His Honour Justice Beach said, ‘ANZ did not act conscionably, did not act transparently, nor did it trade in the way in which it said it would but, to the contrary, it conducted its hedging in a manner which caused undue pricing pressure on the reference price product at the time of pricing. ‘ANZ’s behaviour was particularly serious when coupled with ANZ’s inaccurate and incomplete statements to the AOFM in relation to the manner of its trading and behaviour as a duration manager, when post-completion of the issuance the AOFM expressed concern about the price at which the bond issuance had priced. ANZ’s post-completion conduct reveals a lack of candour and frankness about its trading.’ In deciding to increase the penalty for the misreporting conduct by $10 million to $50 million in total , the Court found ANZ's conduct was both ‘inexcusable’ and had ‘no redeeming feature whatsoever’ and that a ‘very substantial penalty needs to be imposed to achieve both specific deterrence and general deterrence.’ ‘Accurate information is the life-blood of the AOFM in its assessment of the activities in the relevant markets and the position of the participants.’ In his judgment on the retail matters, His Honour Justice Beach reflected on the ‘serious and unacceptable nature of the contraventions’ and that penalties were ‘not to be regarded as a cost of doing business.’ The $35 million penalty for ANZ’s misconduct relating to deceased estates ‘puts a price on the contraventions that is appropriate to deter both repetition by ANZ and contravention by other licensees.’ His Honour noted ANZ had ‘engaged constructively with ASIC in advance of this proceeding being commenced, including by making admissions in relation to its conduct at the earliest available opportunity, acknowledging liability in respect of the admitted contraventions.’ ANZ admitted to the misconduct in September 2025, and together with ASIC, asked the Federal Court to impose penalties of $240 million ( 25-201MR ). Each matter was separately considered and heard by Justice Beach on 2-3 December 2025 and judgment was delivered on 19 December 2025. Downloads Judgments Judgment for bond deal and misreporting of bond trading data Judgment for the three retail matters Initiating proceedings documents Bond deal and misreporting of bond trading data: Originating process and Statement of Agreed Facts Financial hardship: Originating application and Statement of Agreed Facts Bonus interest: Originating process and Statement of Agreed Facts Deceased estates: Originating process and Statement of Agreed Facts Background The four matters filed against ANZ concern: Unconscionable conduct when managing a $14 billion government bond deal and inaccurate reporting of secondary market bond turnover On 19 April 2023, ANZ was assisting the Government’s sovereign debt management agency, the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM), to help deliver a $14 billion bond issuance. Instead of trading gradually throughout the day to limit market impact, ANZ sold a significant volume of 10-year Australian bond futures around the time of pricing which placed undue downward price pressure on the bond price. ANZ knew its trading could expose its client to significant risk of harm, but did not disclose to its client that ANZ still had significant volumes to sell before pricing nor provide its client an opportunity to consult with ANZ about delaying pricing. This denied the Government an opportunity to protect itself and the public interest. The Government was relying on ANZ’s expertise and professionalism. When the Government later asked what happened, ANZ’s reports were misleading or deceptive. The bond deal was raising money to finance government spending for the benefit of all Australians. This is one way the Australian Government funds critical government services, such as health, social welfare, education, infrastructure and defence. ANZ also misled the Government about its trading turnover for nearly two years. This data, among other factors, helps the Government select dealers for bond issuances. ANZ’s inflated figures made it appear more active than it was and occurred despite internal concerns about the accuracy of the data and awareness that the figures could influence future appointments on bond issuances. ANZ admitted to acting unconscionably and misleading the Government. It also admitted to failing to meet its obligations as an Australian financial services licensee. It agreed to seek a combined penalty of $125 million. Financial hardship ANZ failed to respond to 488 customers who submitted financial hardship notices to the bank between May 2022 and September 2024. In some cases, ANZ took more than two years to respond to customers. Personal circumstances reported by customers when providing hardship notices to the bank included unemployment, serious medical issues, bereavement and family violence. In some cases, ANZ took action to recover debts from customers even when they had not responded to the customers’ hardship notices, including issuing default and demand notices, and referring customers to external debt collection agencies. ASIC first notified ANZ of issues with its financial hardship processes in June 2023, however, steps taken by ANZ to fix the issues did not work consistently, resulting in some further failures by ANZ up to September 2024. ANZ has completed a remediation program for affected customers, which has included customer payments totalling $92,687 and corrections to customer credit reports. Bonus interest Between July 2013 and January 2024, ANZ promoted offers on its website to pay introductory bonus interest to customers who opened certain new accounts. However, due to process deficiencies in ANZ’s systems, the bonus interest was not always applied. ANZ remediated 194,487 accounts (7.26% of these accounts opened during the period) as a result of the issue and adopted higher interest rates when in doubt, and remediated secondary impacts and the time value of money. Separately, between August 2024 and March 2025, ANZ promoted on its website base variable and bonus fixed introductory interest rates for certain accounts which were inaccurate. The issue impacted 56,703 customers (46.4% of accounts opened during this period), resulting in ANZ failing to pay the correct amount of interest promised to 26,917 customers, with around $480,000 in interest not paid out. ANZ have remediated these customers. Deceased estates Between July 2019 and June 2023, ANZ failed to refund fees charged to thousands of deceased customers. This is because its systems and processes could not identify which fees should be waived and/or refunded and whether any fees charged after a customer's death had been waived or refunded. ANZ did not respond to representatives of deceased estates in the required timeframe after notification of the customer’s death. ANZ has been unable to identify the total number of affected customers so the full extent of the impact is still unknown. ANZ’s failures are likely to have compounded the difficulties faced by loved ones dealing with the death of a family member or relative, as well as frustrating the probate process. ANZ first identified the systems, controls and processes issue in 2022, and took over a year to resolve it. In response in July 2024 , ANZ was sanctioned for breaches of the Banking Code of Practice by the Banking Code Compliance Committee. Over 18,900 customer accounts were remediated $3.8m by ANZ for fees it did not intend to charge and additional costs arising from delays, with over 9,000 people also contacted to apologise for delays they experienced. Prior misconduct by ANZ across seven matters of concern includes: In 2023, ANZ was ordered to pay a $900,000 penalty for breaching continuous disclosure laws when undertaking a $2.5 billion institutional share placement in 2015 ( 23-332MR ) in circumstances where the maximum penalty applicable at the time was $1 million. In 2023, ANZ was ordered to pay a $10 million penalty for contravening the Credit Act by accepting information and documents from unlicensed third parties in its home loan introducer program ( 23-059MR ). In 2023, ANZ was ordered to pay a $15 million penalty for breaching the Credit Act and the ASIC Act for misleading customers about their available funds for certain credit card accounts, resulting in fees and interest charges ( 23-260MR ). In 2022, ANZ was ordered to pay a $25 million penalty for 155,868 contraventions of the ASIC Act, Corporations Act and Credit Act for failing to provide promised benefits to customers with offset transaction accounts or under a ‘Breakfree’ package over 20 years ( 22-290MR ). In 2020, ANZ was ordered to pay a $10 million penalty for breaching the Corporations Act and the ASIC Act in relation to 327,898 instances of unconscionable conduct over periodic payment fees charged to customers until September 2015 ( 20-232MR ) In 2018, ANZ was ordered to pay a $5 million penalty for breaching responsible lending provisions in the Credit Act for failing to verify customer income in its former Esanda car finance business ( 18-057MR ). In 2017, ANZ was ordered to pay a $10 million penalty for contraventions of the Corporations Act and the ASIC Act for attempting to manipulate the bank bill swap reference rate (BBSW) on ten occasions over an 18-month period ( 17-393MR ).",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The Federal Court has ordered Australian financial services licensee RM Capital Pty Ltd to pay a $575,000 penalty and its authorised representative The SMSF Club Pty Ltd to pay a $350,000 penalty over conflicted remuneration breaches. The penalties follow a Federal Court finding in February 2024 that RM Capital had failed to take reasonable steps between August 2013 and August 2016 to ensure that SMSF Club did not accept conflicted remuneration. The Court also made findings that on multiple occasions between November 2014 and July 2016 SMSF Club accepted conflicted remuneration. It found that SMSF Club received a total of $135,863.65 in referral fees from real estate agent Positive RealEstate Pty Ltd (for assisting SMSF Club clients to set up a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) and purchase property from Positive RealEstate. The referral fees were paid as part of a referral agreement between SMSF Club and Positive Real Estate. On each occasion it accepted a referral fee, SMSF Club breached the provision of the Corporations Act which prohibits an authorised representative from accepting conflicted remuneration. As the licensee that authorised SMSF Club to provide financial services, RM Capital contravened s963F of the Corporations Act by failing to take reasonable steps to ensure SMSF Club did not accept the payments. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘The Court’s judgment reflects RM Capital’s systemic failure to uphold important consumer protection safeguards over a sustained, three-year period. 'RM Capital should have provided proper oversight of SMSF Club as an authorised representative in relation to its compliance with the conflicted remuneration provisions. ‘Conflicted remuneration has the potential to cause consumers to be given financial product advice that is weighted to the provider’s interests and may not suit consumers’ needs,’ the Deputy Chair said. Justice Jackson said, ‘I am conscious that RM Capital is a small organisation with limited resources. But in its capacity as an AFSL holder, these responsibilities were not mere inconvenient distractions from its business activities; they were core responsibilities. ‘That RM Capital took this passive approach even in the face of an ASIC investigation, an adverse liability judgment, and an approaching penalty hearing, suggests that from the point of view of specific deterrence, at least, a high penalty may be necessary to motivate it to change its approach.’ His Honour ordered that within six months: RM Capital is to provide ASIC with a written report of an independent expert stating whether it has in place appropriate systems, policies and procedures to ensure that its representatives comply with s963G(1) of the Corporations Act, SMSF Club is to provide ASIC with a written report of an independent expert stating whether it has in place appropriate systems, policies and procedures to ensure that it complies with s963G(1) of the Corporations Act. Download Judgment Background ASIC commenced civil proceedings in the Federal Court against RM Capital and SMSF Club in relation to accepting conflicted remuneration on 7 June 2019 ( 19-135MR ). ASIC and SMSF Club subsequently filed joint submissions and a statement of agreed facts which included admissions by SMSF Club of contraventions of s963G of the Corporations Act. On 29 February 2024 the Court found that RM Capital failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that its authorised representative, SMSF Club, did not accept conflicted remuneration ( 24-038MR ). An Australian financial services (AFS) licensee must take reasonable steps to ensure that its representatives do not accept conflicted remuneration. Conflicted remuneration is any benefit that could reasonably be expected to influence either the choice of financial product recommended by the licensee or representative or the financial product advice given by the licensee or representative to retail clients. Section 963G of the Act prohibits authorised representatives of AFS licensees from accepting conflicted remuneration. ASIC’s Report 575 SMSFs: Improving the quality of advice and member experiences ( REP 575 ) identifies the conflict of interest concerns when purchasing a property via an SMSF. ASIC’s Regulatory Guide 246 Conflicted and other banned remuneration ( RG 246 ) sets out our guidance on complying with the conflicted and other banned remuneration provisions and how we will administer them. The conflicted and other banned remuneration provisions in Divs 4 and 5 of Pt 7.7A of the Corporations Act apply to financial product advice given to retail clients and certain benefits given in relation to life risk insurance products. ASIC’s Moneysmart website has information for consumers about financial advice , including choosing a financial adviser, understanding if a SMSF is right for you and SMSFS and property .",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC has banned Melbourne-based financial adviser Louis Van Coppenhagen from providing financial services, controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business or performing any function involved in the carrying on of a financial services business for 7 years. ASIC found that Mr Van Coppenhagen, while authorised by MWL Financial Services Pty Ltd ( MWL ), gave inappropriate advice to certain clients which was not in their best interests. Mr Van Coppenhagen recommended certain MWL clients invest most of their superannuation into the ‘High Growth’ or ‘Growth’ class of the Shield Master Fund ( Shield ) which were high risk investments. ASIC also found that Mr Van Coppenhagen, while authorised by United Global Capital Pty Ltd ( UGC ), was instrumental to the implementation of UGC’s advice model including preparing a template Advice Proposal Document. ASIC cancelled UGC’s licence for providing conflicted personal advice concerning highly speculative investments. ASIC has reason to believe that Mr Van Coppenhagen is not a fit and proper person, is not competent and is likely to contravene a financial services law. The banning order took effect from 16 December 2025. Mr Van Coppenhagen‘s banning has been recorded on the Banned and Disqualified Register . Mr Van Coppenhagen has the right to review the decision in the Administrative Review Tribunal. Actions to consider if you are a client of MWL or UGC If you are a client of MWL or UGC and have concerns about the conduct of your adviser or the advice you received, you should consider lodging a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority ( AFCA ). AFCA is the external dispute resolution scheme for financial complaints in Australia and must deal with complaints independently and fairly. AFCA’s service is free for consumers. AFCA can be contacted by: calling 1800 931 678 for free ( 9am – 5pm Melbourne time ), or lodging a complaint online on AFCA’s website . AFCA will consider your complaint if it meets the eligibility criteria. Important deadlines: In cancelling MWL’s licence, ASIC required MWL to remain a member of AFCA until 25 August 2026 . If you intend to lodge a complaint with AFCA in relation to advice received from MWL you should do so by 25 August 2026 . AFCA reinstated UGC’s AFCA membership to ensure impacted consumers can lodge complaints following the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds. If you intend to lodge a complaint with AFCA in relation to advice received from UGC you should do so by 31 March 2026 . Background Mr Van Coppenhagen was previously authorised by UGC from April 2018 to July 2021 and authorised by MWL from 7 August 2022 to June 2023. UGC ASIC was concerned that UGC and its representatives gave conflicted personal advice to clients, specifically those advised to establish a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) and invest in highly speculative investments related to Joel Hewish (UGC’s director). This included a company called Global Capital Property Fund Limited (GCPF). This is despite UGC advisers telling clients they were not receiving personal financial product advice. In July 2024, ASIC banned Mr Hewish for 10 years from providing financial services, performing any function involved in carrying on of a financial services business and controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business. ASIC also cancelled the Australian financial services (AFS) licence of Mr Hewish’s company, UGC ( 24-170MR ). Mr Hewish appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC’s decision which was dismissed by the Administrative Review Tribunal ( 25-160MR ). MWL On 30 September 2025, ASIC was notified that Daniel Juratowitch and Rachel Burdett of Cor Cordis were appointed as voluntary administrators of MWL on 29 September 2025. On 25 August 2025, ASIC cancelled MWL’s Australian Financial Services licence, banned one of MWL’s directors and its responsible manager ( 25-181MR , 25-180MR ). Mr Videkanic is another former MWL financial adviser who has been banned by ASIC in respect of advice provided in relation to Shield ( 25-127MR , 25-128MR , 25-146MR , 25-243MR ). In February 2024, ASIC halted new offers of investments in Shield. ASIC made interim stop orders on four product disclosure statements for Shield ( 24-018MR ). In June 2024, ASIC took action to secure the assets held within Shield ( 24-129MR ). ASIC sought orders to preserve the assets of the scheme so that they may be recovered, to the extent available, for the benefit of investors while the investigation is continuing.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Macquarie Securities (Australia) Limited (MSAL) has admitted to misleading conduct in relation to the misreporting millions of short sales over several years, caused by repeated failures in its systems and processes. ASIC and MSAL will ask the NSW Supreme Court to impose a penalty of $35 million and to make other orders against MSAL. The penalty and orders are subject to consideration and approval by the Court. In a statement of agreed facts filed with the Court, MSAL has admitted it failed to correctly report at least 73 million short sales between 11 December 2009 and 14 February 2024. It is estimated that MSAL misreported between 298 million and 1.5 billion short sales. The inaccurate reporting was due to multiple systems-related failures, many of which remained undetected for more than a decade. In addition to the misleading conduct, MSAL has also admitted it failed to: have appropriate supervisory policies and procedures, have and maintain the necessary organisational and technical resources, and have adequate risk management systems to ensure compliance with its short sale reporting obligations. MSAL has also admitted to incorrectly reporting regulatory data for more than 633,000 orders submitted to the market operator between 16 November 2022 and 21 March 2023. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, ‘Accurate and reliable data underpins confidence in our financial markets. ASIC and the market rely on short sale and regulatory reporting data - especially during periods of volatility - to understand market activity and make informed decisions. ‘Without accurate data, market transparency is undermined. ‘Market participants must have the proper systems and processes in place to comply with their regulatory obligations. ‘It’s essential for public transparency, market integrity and trust in our system.’ ASIC’s action against MSAL is part of our broader body of work addressing misconduct and failures to comply with regulatory obligations by large Australian financial institutions. Background Short selling is the practice of a seller selling a financial product (including a security) that the seller does not currently own and with the intention of benefiting from that sale in various ways. ASIC initiated civil proceedings against MSAL in this case on 14 May 2025 ( 25-074MR ). This is ASIC's first short-sale reporting case. MSAL has admitted to contraventions of s798H(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act) by reason of breaches of the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017 : Rule 2.1.3 - failing to have appropriate supervisory policies and procedures, Rule 5.5.2 - failing to have and maintain necessary organisational and technical resources, and Rule 7.4.2 - failing to provide correct Regulatory Data to the market operator. MSAL has also admitted to a contravention of each of the following provisions of the Corporations Act: s912A(1)(h) – failing to have adequate risk management systems, and s1041H(1) – engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in relation to a financial product. Further information on short selling, reporting and disclosure obligations can be found in Regulatory Guide 196 Short Selling ( RG 196 ).",

The court-enforceable undertaking accepted by the ACCC requires Coles to divest its ownership and interest in a site at the nearby Kororoit Town Centre. The two proposed acquisitions combined with Coles’ interest in the Kororoit site would have meant consumers would have limited choice beyond Coles supermarkets in the relevant local area. Mt Atkinson, Deanside and Kororoit are all areas close to each other, in the Melton Growth Corridor, northwest of Melbourne. Each of the relevant Coles sites in these areas is suitable for large format supermarkets. The ACCC had concerns the proposed acquisitions would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in the retail supply of groceries and household products within the local markets of each of Deanside Central and Mt Atkinson. Coles has undertaken to divest the Kororoit site to Neale Deanside Developments Pty Ltd, trading as Oreana, so that it will be available for a competitor to enter the local area.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA and AUSTRAC take action in response to risk management deficiencies at Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Thursday 18 December 2025 Print Email APRA and AUSTRAC have both announced actions to address weaknesses in Bendigo and Adelaide Bank’s (Bendigo Bank) money laundering risk management, non‑financial risk management practices and risk culture. It follows the findings of an independent review undertaken by Deloitte into suspected money laundering at a Bendigo Bank branch, which the bank reported to AUSTRAC. This independent review found significant deficiencies with Bendigo Bank’s approach to the identification, mitigation and management of money laundering and terrorism financing risk. APRA is concerned that the weaknesses identified by that investigation may be applicable across the bank’s operations more broadly. AUSTRAC shares APRA’s concerns. As a result, APRA and AUSTRAC are today announcing the following actions, which are coordinated to ensure Bendigo Bank intensifies its efforts to strengthen its non-financial risk management systems and practices: APRA will require Bendigo Bank to undertake a root cause analysis to understand the extent of non-financial risk management issues at the bank, going beyond money laundering and terrorism financing; APRA will require Bendigo Bank to hold an operational risk capital add-on of $50 million; and AUSTRAC has commenced an enforcement investigation which will focus on whether Bendigo Bank has complied with its obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act). APRA Chair John Lonsdale said: “Although Bendigo and Adelaide Bank is financially sound and comfortably above its core capital and liquidity requirements, we are concerned there may be significant gaps in its risk management framework that need to be addressed urgently. “While the non-financial risk, anti‑money laundering spaces are a priority in light of the recent independent report, APRA is concerned that similar weaknesses may exist across the bank. “The measures we are announcing today alongside AUSTRAC aim to ensure that fundamental deficiencies in Bendigo Bank’s risk management framework are identified and addressed and those responsible are held to account as appropriate.” AUSTRAC Acting CEO Katie Miller said AUSTRAC has been closely monitoring Bendigo Bank’s compliance with its AML/CTF obligations. “This enforcement investigation follows supervisory engagement with Bendigo Bank and the bank’s recent disclosure of deficiencies in its approach to the identification, mitigation, and management of money laundering and terrorism financing risks,” Ms Miller said. “Our investigation will examine Bendigo Bank’s compliance with the AML/CTF Act and inform any further AUSTRAC action.” The capital add-on will remain in place until Bendigo Bank has completed remedial measures and addressed wider concerns to APRA’s satisfaction. Today’s actions do not preclude further actions from being taken by the agencies in the future.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA imposes additional licence conditions on Equity Trustees Superannuation Limited Thursday 18 December 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has imposed additional licence conditions on Equity Trustees Superannuation Limited (ETSL) to address prudential concerns relating to its investment governance frameworks and practices, including oversight of platform investment options made available to members. ETSL acts as trustee for 11 registrable superannuation entities (RSEs) and has approximately 649,000 member accounts and over $37 billion in funds under management. The additional licence conditions follow APRA’s recent thematic review of the investment governance, strategic planning and member outcomes practices of superannuation trustees that offer platforms (‘Platform Trustees’). Broadly, the review identified deficiencies in ETSL’s onboarding processes and practices, including adequacy of investment selection criteria and due diligence, as well as investment option monitoring and reporting frameworks, and management of conflicts of interest. Specifically, APRA’s review of ETSL identified concerns regarding: onboarding of new investment options to ensure they are assessed consistently, are in the best financial interests of members, and appropriately manage conflicts of interest; adequate knowledge, operational and investment due diligence undertaken in relation to new investment options; identifying key risks, and ensuring independent analysis of information received from investment managers and external research and rating agencies; and the adequacy of investment monitoring and reporting to identify and manage higher risk investment options. Under the additional licence conditions, effective 18 December 2025, ETSL is required to: appoint an independent expert to undertake separate reviews of its platforms’ investment menus and investment governance framework; develop and implement an uplift plan to address identified gaps, and provide APRA with assurance or attestation that the remediation actions are complete and effective; and undertake a further review of its investment menu against the enhanced investment governance requirements to determine ongoing suitability of each investment option. ETSL must also refrain from onboarding certain new high-risk investment options to its platform until an independent expert confirms the option has gone through the uplifted onboarding process and an accountable person attests that all reasonable steps were taken to ensure the option is in members’ best financial interests. These actions build on APRA’s public letter of 7 October 2025 , which indicated that APRA would escalate supervisory intensity as necessary to ensure that appropriate steps are being taken by Platform Trustees to lift investment governance and member outcomes practices. Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said: \"APRA reiterates robust investment governance, including in relation to onboarding and monitoring of platform investment options, is critical to safeguard the interests of members. The accountabilities of trustees are the same irrespective of their business model and cannot be outsourced.\" APRA will continue to coordinate closely with ASIC on the regulatory response to weaknesses identified in Platform Trustees.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA accepts court enforceable undertaking from Netwealth Thursday 18 December 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has accepted a court enforceable undertaking (CEU) from Netwealth Superannuation Services Pty Ltd (Netwealth) to address material weaknesses in its investment governance framework and practices. Netwealth has around 115,000 member accounts and over $40 billion in funds under management. This action follows APRA’s recent thematic review of the investment governance, strategic planning and member outcomes practices of superannuation trustees that offer platforms, which identified deficiencies in Netwealth’s onboarding due diligence and monitoring of investment options, as well as management of outsourced investment services and related conflicts of interest. In particular, APRA’s review identified concerns regarding Netwealth’s: oversight, knowledge and due diligence of new investment options offered to members on its platform; triggers and controls relied upon to monitor and review investment options and ensure any performance or risk concerns are escalated and addressed appropriately; and management of potential conflicts of interest arising from outsourcing services to its related party, Netwealth Investments 1 , and with other third parties that operate, manage, or advise on platform investment options. While Netwealth has since made, and is progressing, improvements to its investment governance framework, APRA remains concerned with the deficiencies identified through its thematic review. APRA requires assurance, with appropriate oversight by an independent expert, that Netwealth will make the necessary improvements to ensure its investment governance framework and practices are fit-for-purpose to protect members’ interests. Netwealth has acknowledged APRA’s concerns in the CEU and has committed to: engage an independent expert to perform a review of high-risk investment options on its platform menu, ensuring the continued inclusion of each option is in members’ best financial interests and any related findings of the review are addressed; engage an independent expert to perform a review of its investment governance framework ( Framework Review ); develop and implement a remediation uplift plan to rectify any deficiencies or incorporate improvements identified through the Framework Review, and provide APRA with assurance that the actions have been implemented; and review all investment options on its investment menu against the uplifted investment governance requirements, including enhanced onboarding and monitoring criteria, to determine their ongoing suitability. As part of the undertaking, Netwealth must also refrain from onboarding certain 2 new high-risk investment options to the platform until the independent expert confirms the new option has gone through the uplifted onboarding process and an attestation is provided that all reasonable steps were taken to ensure the new option is in members’ best financial interests. In parallel, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has commenced proceedings against Netwealth for contraventions of the Corporations Act 2001 and also accepted a court-enforceable undertaking to ensure members are paid 100 per cent of the amounts they invested in First Guardian less any amounts withdrawn. APRA and ASIC have collaborated closely on their regulatory response to these issues to ensure coordinated and strong outcomes for members and will continue to do so, consistent with their distinct yet complementary mandates over superannuation trustees. APRA’s acceptance of the CEU follows its public letter of 7 October 2025 , which called on superannuation trustees to accelerate and escalate efforts to safeguard members’ investments held in platform products. Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said: “Robust investment governance, including in relation to onboarding and monitoring of platform investment options, is critical to safeguard the interests of members. APRA will maintain a strong focus on investment governance, particularly in the platform segment, throughout 2026.” The CEU is available at: List of enforceable undertakings Footnotes 1 Netwealth primarily outsources the operation of the Netwealth Superannuation Master Fund (Fund) to Netwealth Investments, a related body corporate of Netwealth. Netwealth Investments is a platform provider, administrator and custodian of the Fund. 2 Netwealth has agreed to not onboard any new Platform Investment Options (except Excluded Platform Investment Options) before first meeting the enhanced onboarding requirements as set out in the Court Enforceable Undertaking .

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Netwealth has agreed to pay over $100 million in compensation to more than 1,000 Australians who invested their superannuation in the First Guardian Master Fund and has admitted it contravened the Corporations Act. ASIC has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Netwealth Superannuation Services Pty Ltd (NSS) and Netwealth Investments Limited (NIL), as trustees of the Netwealth Superannuation Master Fund (NSMF). NSS and NIL have admitted they failed to obtain and therefore did not assess sufficient information about the First Guardian Master Fund, or make sufficient independent enquiries, to understand or evaluate the investment risk in the First Guardian Diversified Class and Growth Class prior to or while offering them as investment options to NSMF members. ASIC will seek orders that NSS and NIL failed to do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by their financial services licences were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly. ASIC has also accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from NSS and NIL to ensure members are compensated 100% of the amounts they invested in First Guardian less any amounts withdrawn. The compensation payments will be made by 30 January 2026. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said the ongoing investigation into First Guardian including work to recover available money for investors was at the heart of ASIC’s enforcement priorities. ‘This is a welcome outcome for many Australians and stems the significant losses that threatened their retirement savings. ‘More than 1,000 members who invested through Netwealth’s superannuation platform were facing huge uncertainty when First Guardian collapsed. ‘ASIC’s investigation will ensure Netwealth restores these members to the position they were in before they saw their savings eroded. ‘This is the fourth action we’ve taken against a superannuation trustee in relation to our ongoing First Guardian and Shield investigations, and follows ASIC securing the payment of $321 million to Shield investors by Macquarie’, the Deputy Chair said. NSS and NIL have admitted the allegations in the proceeding. It is a matter for the Court to determine whether the declarations are appropriate. ASIC will not seek a pecuniary penalty due to the exceptional circumstances of this matter, including: the strong public interest in obtaining a timely court-based outcome which will encourage other superannuation trustees to comply with their legal obligations in the context of choice platforms, the interests of providing affected members who invested into First Guardian through a regulated superannuation fund with certainty in a timely manner, and the level of cooperation demonstrated by NSS and NIL in agreeing to compensate members 100% of the amounts invested in First Guardian less any amounts withdrawn, without waiting for an outcome of the First Guardian liquidation or proceedings against other parties involved. ‘The action we’ve taken in the last few months puts super trustees well on notice: they are gatekeepers for their members’ retirement savings and ASIC expects them to take active steps to monitor the funds they make available on their choice platforms. ‘ASIC now has 12 cases underway against 20 defendants and is continuing to investigate misconduct relating to Shield and First Guardian to hold those involved to account’, the Deputy Chair said. ASIC notes that APRA accepted a Court Enforceable Undertaking from NSS on 17 December 2025 to uplift its processes and procedures for investment governance. ASIC and APRA continue to work closely together to hold trustees of regulated super funds to account consistent with ASIC and APRA’s respective mandates. Downloads Originating Process (PDF 580KB) Statement of Agreed Facts and Admissions (PDF 631KB) ASIC’s Court Enforceable Undertaking APRA’s Court Enforceable Undertaking Background ASIC will seek declarations that NSS and NIL contravened sections 912A(1)(a) and 912A(5A) of the Corporations Act. NSS and NIL are subsidiaries of Netwealth Group Limited which is listed on the ASX. NIL (until 30 June 2021) and NSS (from 1 July 2021) were the trustees of the NSMF. The NSMF is a public offer retail superannuation fund. NSMF has around 115,000 member accounts and over $40 billion in funds under management. The NSMF offers members access to two choice superannuation products – Super Accelerator Core and Super Accelerator Plus. The First Guardian Growth and Diversified classes were first made available to adviser-led members through Netwealth’s Super Accelerator Plus product on 26 March 2021. The First Guardian classes were closed to new investments on 28 December 2022. Between 26 March 2021 and 28 December 2022, approximately $128.5 million was invested across the two First Guardian classes by 1,303 members. 1,084 members were still invested in First Guardian when Falcon Capital froze redemptions in May 2024, with member investments totalling approximately $100.6 million. In May 2024 Falcon Capital Limited, the Responsible Entity of First Guardian, temporarily suspended the processing of applications and withdrawals from First Guardian, to allow for a restructure of the fund and its underlying assets. The suspension was never lifted and in February 2025 ASIC took action to freeze the assets of Falcon Capital Limited and First Guardian. Following action by ASIC, Falcon Capital was placed into liquidation. Ross Blakeley and Paul Harlond of FTI Consulting were appointed as liquidators of Falcon Capital and were directed to wind up First Guardian. The liquidators issued an update report to unitholders and creditors of First Guardian on 2 December 2025: FTI Consulting .

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email The Federal Court has found that blockchain mining companies NGS Group Limited, NGS Crypto Pty Ltd and NGS Digital Pty Ltd operated a financial services business without an Australian financial services (AFS) licence. NGS Group, NGS Crypto and NGS Digital have been permanently restrained by the Court from operating a financial services business. The Court has ordered that NGS Group, NGS Crypto and an unregistered managed investment scheme operated by NGS Group be wound up and liquidators appointed. Over 450 Australians invested approximately $59 million with NGS Group over a 6-year period, with many investing their retirement savings via self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) that NGS Crypto encouraged them to establish. In reaching its decision, the Court found that the NGS companies operated and promoted an unregistered managed investment scheme ‘in blatant contravention of the Corporations Act.’ Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘The NGS companies showed a complete disregard for the Australian financial services laws and denied investors fundamental protections, leaving them exposed to the significant risk of financial losses. ‘This was compounded by encouraging people to invest through self-managed superannuation funds, putting their retirement savings outside a licensed regime. ‘The licensing regime is designed to ensure people receive proper information about what they’re investing in from people who are qualified to provide advice in their best interests, and that their investments are properly managed. ‘Investments in crypto-related products like blockchain mining may be regulated under financial services laws and it is incumbent on companies or individuals offering these products to Australian investors to ensure they comply with the law,’ Ms Court said. In deciding to wind up NGS Group, the Court held that investors were harmed by NGS Group’s failure to hold an AFS licence and found that there is a wholly justifiable lack of confidence in the conduct and management of NGS Group. In relation to NGS Crypto, the Court found that NGS Crypto carried on a business in contravention of the Corporations Act at the expense of hundreds of investors. Her Honour Acting Chief Justice Collier held that ‘after becoming aware of ASIC’s concerns regarding its operations, the controller of NGS Crypto did not rectify the fatal flaws in its operations. In those circumstances, I have no confidence in the conduct and management of NGS Crypto in respect of its affairs.’ Download Judgment Background The Court ordered Anthony Connelly, Katherine Sozou, and William James Harris of McGrathNicol be appointed as liquidators to NGS Group, NGS Crypto and the unregistered managed investment scheme operated by NGS Group. The NGS Companies targeted Australian investors, encouraging them to use superannuation funds to invest in blockchain mining packages promising fixed-rate returns. On 10 April 2024, the Federal Court made orders appointing Anthony Connelly, Katherine Sozou, and William James Harris of McGrathNicol as receivers over the digital currency assets of the NGS Companies and of directors Brett Mendham, Mark Ten Caten and Ryan Brown. ASIC applied for these orders because it was concerned that the digital assets of investors, which are invested in the blockchain mining products offered by the NGS Companies, were at risk of dissipation and considered the appointment of a receiver was the best way to protect the assets. The Court also made orders restraining Mr Mendham from travelling outside of Australia. ASIC sought winding up orders against NGS Group, NGS Crypto and the unregistered managed investment scheme as it considered that winding up orders and the appointment of liquidators was the best way to facilitate an orderly resolution of the companies’ affairs in Australia and the distribution of any recoverable assets, including those held by the receivers, back to investors. The Court agreed, stating in relation to the winding up of the scheme that ‘the scheme’s members have the best chance of recovering at least some of their contributed funds through a liquidation process . ’ ASIC’s investigation into the NGS Companies and their directors is otherwise continuing. ASIC provides updates on this matter on its NGS Crypto Companies webpage.",

The cancellation came into effect at the end of day on 16 December 2025. Mr Danieli has applied to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a stay and review of the CADB’s decision. For certain types of audits, including for listed companies, the auditing standards require an engagement partner to engage and discuss significant matters and judgements arising during the audit engagement with a second person, now known as an ‘engagement quality reviewer’ ( EQR ). ASIC’s investigation uncovered what it alleged in the CADB were multiple and systemic breaches of the auditing standard requirements related to the engagement quality review by Mr Danieli in his capacity as engagement partner. The CADB found that Mr Danieli did not have any discussions with the EQR prior to Mr Danieli signing and dating the audit reports across 5 ASX-listed companies audited in each of FY23 and FY24. The engagement quality reviews across the 10 audits were never completed. The CADB determined that Mr Danieli repeatedly and without justification breached his duties as an auditor, and that Mr Danieli knew or ought to have known what was required of him, particularly as he was reminded by third parties of his obligations, yet persisted in breaching them. The CADB found that Mr Danieli’s conduct was serious and prolonged and he is not a person of the character who can be relied upon to comply with mandatory auditing standards. The CADB also ordered: publication of its decision, and Mr Danieli pay ASIC’s costs fixed at $73,000.

    "full_text": "Date 18 December 2025 Topics Compliance and enforcement The ACCC has accepted a court enforceable undertaking from Golf Imports Pty Ltd after the golf equipment supplier admitted to engaging in resale price maintenance by prohibiting retailers from selling its products below a set price, in breach of Australian competition law. Golf Imports is an Australian importer and wholesaler that supplies well-known brands such as Callaway to prominent golf retailers including Drummond Golf, GolfBox, and Golf World. Golf Imports admitted that between April 2022 and July 2025, it included clauses in documents published on Golf Imports’ website that prohibited retailers from advertising their products below Golf Imports’ specified price. Under Australian competition law, it is illegal for suppliers to prevent, or attempt to prevent, resellers from advertising or selling goods or services below a specified minimum price. This conduct is known as resale price maintenance. “Price competition is a fundamental part of our market economy, and central to that is retailers being able to set their prices as they see fit,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “Resale price maintenance can keep prices higher than they otherwise would be and cause significant consumer harm, particularly at a time of increased cost of living pressure.” “Suppliers should be aware that any attempt to engage in resale price maintenance could result in ACCC enforcement action, including court proceedings where appropriate,” Ms Lowe said. The illegal clauses that prohibited retailers from advertising the price of products for an amount that was less than the price Golf Imports had specified were contained in Golf Imports’ Online Policy and Supply Agreement. These clauses stated that Golf Imports would suspend or terminate the retailer’s  ability to advertise or sell any goods supplied by Golf Imports if the retailer did not comply with this pricing restriction.  Golf Imports did not take further steps to enforce those clauses after they were published on its website. Golf Imports’ undertaking, which is in effect for three years, requires it to remove all relevant clauses from its online policy and supply agreement, communicate these changes to its customers, and implement a compliance program. A copy of the undertaking is available at here: Golf Imports Pty Ltd Background Golf Imports was established in 2006. Its product guide contains over 100 pages of products, stocking several well-known golf brands including Callaway. Golf Imports is the exclusive Australian distributor of products by Izzo Golf, Infiniti Golf and Golf Pride. It is illegal for businesses of any size to impose minimum prices for the resale of their goods or services. For example, suppliers must not: set minimum prices in formal policies or agreements; offer retailers a discount if they sell at or above a minimum price; refuse to supply retailers that sell below a minimum price; or punish retailers for selling below a set price, for example, by taking away a discount or sending a warning. In December 2023, the Federal Court ordered power tool supplier, Techtronic, to pay penalties totalling $15 million after it admitted it had engaged in resale price maintenance conduct.

    "full_text": "Date 18 December 2025 Topics Advertising and promotions Buying and selling products and services The ACCC has written to a number of major retailers ahead of the Boxing Day sales to remind them of their obligations under the Australian Consumer Law when advertising sales and promotions. These letters follow a Black Friday Sales sweep by the ACCC to identify misleading or deceptive sales advertising by retailers. Initial findings from the ACCC’s sweep indicate that retailers are still using a range of potentially misleading strategies during promotions, including misleading time representations (such as the use of countdown timers that may not align with the full duration of the sale), and promotions that may misrepresent the true scope of discounts available to consumers. The ACCC will continue to assess the results of its sweep and will take next steps as appropriate. “All retailers must ensure that any sales or discount claims they make during the Boxing Day sales are accurate, clear and not likely to mislead or deceive consumers,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “We are concerned that despite many warnings, some retailers are still using a range of tactics to misrepresent the size or scope of discounts and the duration of sales to consumers.” “Misleading pricing practices in the retail sector is a compliance and enforcement priority for the ACCC, and we will continue to closely monitor any sales or discount claims made, particularly by large retailers,” Ms Lowe said. Retailers should review the ACCC’s guidance on advertising and promotions to ensure they are complying with the Australian Consumer Law. “If a retailer is found to be in breach of the law, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action,” Ms Lowe said. Sales and discounts are persuasive techniques used by retailers to influence consumer purchasing decisions. “As sales periods become longer and more frequent, we want to ensure that the discounts being advertised to consumers are genuine,” Ms Lowe said. The ACCC encourages consumers to be wary of broad claims about discounts or savings during sales periods and to check for any disclaimers or conditions in sales advertisements. “We encourage consumers to shop around, compare, and keep an eye on prices before big sales events like Boxing Day, particularly if you have been waiting to make a significant purchase. Focus on the final price, not the advertised discount or promotion, to assess whether you are getting a good deal,” Ms Lowe said. The best way for consumers to report any potentially misleading or deceiving sales representations is by the ACCC website , where images and specific detail can be provided. Background The ACCC expects retailers to not make the following representations in any sales promotions: Misleading time representations, including, the use of phrases such as ‘3 days only’ and devices such as countdown timers that don’t align with the true duration of the sale. Claims of store-wide or site-wide sales, when in fact the sales involve exclusions. Fine print or disclaimers that seek to limit headline claims about the sale, including member-only deals or excluding a range of products. ‘Up to X% off’, where the ‘up to’ text is not prominently displayed, or where few or very few products are on sale at X% off. Misleading ‘was/now’ or ‘strikethrough’ pricing representations. In 2024, the ACCC conducted a sweep of sales advertising by Australian retailers online and in store to target the Black Friday and Boxing Day sale periods. The 2024 sweep uncovered a range of concerning practices, including those listed above. Following the sweep, the ACCC launched a number of investigations into specific retailers and wrote to those retailers where the most concerning conduct was identified and asked them to justify their claims. In June 2025, Michael Hill, My House and Hairhouse online paid penalties for allegedly making false and misleading representations about their Black Friday sales. The ACCC has a number of other investigations relating to misleading and deceptive sales practices underway. Examples of advertising that may raise concerns Above: Example of the use of a countdown time which, if not accurate, can create a false sense of urgency. Above: Example of a retailer that advertises a ‘sitewide’ sale when in fact there are a range of products which are excluded from the sale. Above: Example of an ‘Up to’ X% off claim, where ‘up to’ text is easily missed by consumers.

Following an application by ASIC, the Federal Court ordered on 15 December 2025 that Robert Woods and Salvatore Algeri, of Deloitte SRT Pty Ltd, be appointed as receivers to the property of Mr Cotton and First Mutual (the Defendants). The orders made on 10 September 2025 freezing their assets remain in place (refer 25-200MR and 25-260MR ). The Receivers have been appointed until 17 April 2026 and they are required to: identify and secure the property of the Defendants; determine the amount of investor funds received by the Defendants; identify the uses made of investor funds by the Defendants; provide a report to the Court on these matters by 20 February 2026. ASIC took this action due to its concerns about the use of investor funds by Mr Cotton (including for gambling) to enable the Receivers to identify any assets belonging to the Defendants, including loans made to third parties. On the application of the Defendants, the Court also ordered that they be allowed to withdraw a further sum $250,000 from the bank accounts which are subject to the freezing orders, for the sole purpose of paying their legal costs. The next hearing has been fixed for 10 April 2026. Background ASIC is investigating First Mutual Private Equity Pty Ltd and its director, Gregory Raymond Cotton, due to concerns that they may have allegedly raised up to $131 million in investor funds and that ASIC’s investigation indicates that around $80 million has allegedly been spent on gambling, with no actual investment activity found. At present, around $7.1 million of total assets of the funds invested have been identified. ASIC secured initial freezing orders over their assets in August 2025 to protect funds while the investigation continues (refer 25-174MR ) More information for investors is available on ASIC’s website.",

    "full_text": "Date 17 December 2025 Topics Compliance and enforcement Banking and finance The ACCC has accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from Equifax Australasia Workforce Solutions Pty Ltd in which Equifax has agreed not to enter into any new agreements preventing Equifax’s competitors from being able to access electronic payroll and superannuation data. Equifax is part of a corporate group which operates a large and well-established credit bureau in Australia. It has operated a verification exchange service in Australia since 2020. Payroll and superannuation data is used to provide automated income verification services across Australia, as many lenders are transitioning their income verification practices towards automated solutions. The undertaking offered by Equifax follows a detailed investigation by the ACCC into whether Equifax’s contracts amounted to unlawful exclusive dealing that had the purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. The ACCC was particularly concerned about terms in the agreement Equifax entered into in 2021 with SuperChoice Services, one of the largest holders of payroll and superannuation  data willing to supply data to third parties for income verification purposes. “Equifax’s contract prevented SuperChoice from supplying data to other Australian suppliers of income verification services and included a clause requiring SuperChoice to phase out sharing data with one of Equifax’s competitors,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. “Whether it’s for home loans, car loans or a new credit card, consumers across Australia apply for financing every day. Their lenders, mortgage brokers and aggregators use income verification services to check their income to facilitate their financing needs.” “Harm to competition in a crucial part of the lending process, such as income verification, can have flow on effects to consumers in terms of choice, quality and price,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. The agreement also incentivised SuperChoice’s exclusive supply of data to Equifax through a revenue sharing arrangement. “We considered Equifax’s contract with one of its key suppliers to be a case of anti-competitive exclusive dealing by Equifax that needed to be stopped to protect the competitive process. In evolving markets, exclusive agreements, particularly by large established firms, can deter entry and innovation,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “Competition in the digital economy is a key priority for the ACCC and we will continue to take enforcement action against businesses that engage in unlawful anti-competitive conduct.” As a result of the ACCC’s investigation, Equifax stopped relying on the exclusivity and revenue sharing provisions in its agreement with SuperChoice in May 2025. It amended the agreement to remove these clauses in September 2025. Equifax has also informed other data holders that they are not prevented from supplying data to Equifax’s competitors or any other party. Companies who access data for income verification purposes must comply with Australia’s privacy laws. More information and details of the undertaking can be found at Equifax Australasia Workforce Solutions Pty Ltd .

AI technologies and markets are developing rapidly, raising potential competition implications The ACCC’s AI snapshot examined recent trends and developments in AI technology, noting several advances in foundation models and AI applications, including advancements in AI agents, since the ACCC’s March 2025 report. “Our snapshot has outlined increasing interconnections between AI offerings and existing digital platform services, often supplied by tech giants, as AI technology matures,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “While these integrations can improve user experience, they may also have negative implications by raising barriers to entry or expansion, and consumers’ ability and willingness to switch service providers.” The ACCC’s snapshot also reviews the developments in agentic AI, including AI agents. “Use of agentic AI has the potential to impact how users deal with businesses online, or use digital platform services such as searching the internet,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “Their use may also give rise to new risks, such as the possibility of AI agents colluding, even where this is not expressly intended or programmed by human creators.” The ACCC’s snapshot also explores the significant activity in terms of investments, acquisitions and partnerships in the AI sector globally and in Australia. “Major digital platforms and AI firms are making substantial investments at all levels of the AI supply chain to support the development of more advanced AI models and to meet future demand,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “These include direct investment in AI infrastructure, partnerships between key firms, and competition to attract a limited pool of technical expertise including through ‘acquihires’. The ACCC will continue to closely monitor deals and conduct in Australia.” Increasing consumer and business uptake of AI may amplify risks of consumer harms The AI snapshot identified several emerging risks to consumers related to increasing use of AI services. Potential consumer issues include the widespread use and collection of consumers’ data, use of AI to facilitate false representations or generate large volumes of fake reviews and facilitate and enhance online scams. “The integration of AI into various digital products and services is already delivering benefits to Australian consumers, including by enabling new app functionalities and simplifying some tasks,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “However, AI also has the potential to amplify existing consumer risks relating to how businesses communicate with consumers, whether consumers are well-informed about businesses’ use of their data, and risks posed by scammers.” For example, research commissioned by the ACCC for its March 2025 Final Report of the Digital Platform Services Inquiry indicates 83 per cent of surveyed Australian consumers  believe companies should get consent before using personal data to train AI models. However, the ACCC’s snapshot reveals that vast amounts of consumer data is currently already collected and used to train AI models, often without consumers’ knowledge or informed consent.

Emerging AI technologies need continued scrutiny from governments and regulators “The pace of continued changes since the ACCC provided the Australian Government with the Final Report of the Digital Platform Services Inquiry in March this year underscores the importance of regulators and governments continuing to monitor changing digital technologies,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. The ACCC continues to strongly support the Government’s commitment to implement a new digital competition regime in response to the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Services Inquiry recommendations. Background: The ACCC’s Digital Markets Branch conducted a five-year inquiry into markets for the supply of digital platform services in Australia and their impacts on competition and consumers, following a direction from the Treasurer in 2020. In the fifth DPSI interim report on regulatory reform , the ACCC made a range of recommendations to bolster competition in the digital economy, level the playing field between big tech companies and Australian businesses, and reduce prices for consumers. The recommendations include new service-specific mandatory codes of conduct for particular ‘designated digital platforms,’ based on principles set out in legislation. In December 2023, the Government accepted the ACCC’s findings that existing competition provisions by themselves are not sufficient to address current or potential future competition harms and supported-in-principle the development of a new digital competition regime. In December 2024, the Government began consultation on the implementation of a new digital competition regime in Australia. The March 2025 Final Report of the Digital Platform Services Inquiry reiterated the ACCC’s support for a new digital competition regime, and also made two new recommendations to Government, that: the ACCC should continue to have a monitoring function for emerging digital technologies under the proposed digital competition regime, and that the Australian Government should prioritise a whole-of-government approach to digital platform regulation and endorse the Digital Platform Regulators Forum (DP-REG) as a permanent forum with adequate resources to undertake information-sharing and collaboration between Australian digital platform regulators. Notes to editors ‘Acquihires’ refer to acquisitions, partnerships or other arrangements between firms where the primary goal is acquiring access to employees’ talent and expertise. ‘AI agents’ are software systems that can autonomously perform tasks with minimal input from human users. ‘Artificial intelligence (AI)’ refer to the ability of computer software to perform tasks that are complex enough to simulate a level of capability or understanding usually associated with human intelligence. ‘Foundation models’ are general purpose AI models which are trained on large datasets, and allow developers to build AI applications. ‘Generative AI’ refer to a specific type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms trained to learn the patterns and structure of their training data, and generate new content in response to prompts.

They pose real threats that erode trust, tarnish reputations, and cause lasting harm to consumers, investors, and the entire financial ecosystem,’ ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke said. ‘Effective conflict management is more than a regulatory checkbox—it’s the cornerstone of trust in financial services. The updated Regulatory Guide 181 AFS Licensing: Managing Conflicts of Interest (RG 181) sets out clear, principles-based guidance for Australian financial services (AFS) licensees. It aims to help licensees fulfil their licensing obligation to have robust arrangements and tailored conflict management strategies in place. Key updates include: how the law applies to conflicts of interest, including the scope of the conflicts management obligation and links to other related obligations the types of conflicts AFS licensees should identify and manage the need for robust, tailored arrangements to manage conflicts practical steps for effective conflict management, and a non-exhaustive ‘catalogue’ of related legal obligations and information. The revised RG 181 replaces guidance issued in August 2004 and is part of ASIC’s ongoing regulatory maintenance and simplification agenda —making it easier for businesses to access regulatory information and understand their obligations. Consultation feedback and ASIC’s response Between 30 July and 5 September 2025, ASIC consulted publicly on proposed updates to RG 181. ASIC received 26 submissions from industry, industry groups and other interested parties, with broad support for simplifying and updating the guidance. Most feedback focused on technical details and specific guidance, such as the illustrative examples ASIC provided to identify different types of conflicts of interest. ASIC updated RG 181 to address this feedback, where appropriate, and we have summarised our responses to key feedback . You can read these responses along with the 22 non-confidential submissions to ASIC’s public consultation on the relevant consultation paper webpage . Background Conflicts of interest are a significant source of misconduct as well as consumer, investor and economic harm within the financial services sector. Under section 912A(1)(aa) of the Corporations Act 2001 , AFS licensees must have adequate arrangements in place to effectively manage all conflicts of interest, except those that occur wholly outside a financial services business. The management of conflicts of interest was raised as an area requiring further clarification in a number of submissions to ASIC’s discussion paper on the evolving dynamics in public and private markets , and was a compliance issue identified in ASIC’s private credit surveillance report ( REP 820 ). The issuance of the updated RG 181 was outlined as a deliverable in ASIC’s roadmap for the next 12-18 months, released as part of our response to the discussion paper in November ( REP 823 ).

ASIC has also cancelled Ms Trieu’s Australian credit licence. Ms Trieu held a credit licence from 12 October 2011 and provided mortgage broking services including arranging home loans. ASIC found that Ms Trieu: contravened credit legislation by making false or misleading statements to ASIC in two annual compliance certificates, as she omitted any reference to: her termination as a broker with two lenders and an aggregator; and her having adequate arrangements and systems in place for compliance with the general conduct obligations of Australian credit licensees (Compliance Arrangements); is not a fit and proper person to participate in the credit industry as she: made false or misleading statements in documents she was required to lodge with ASIC as an Australian credit licensee; failed to maintain books and records evidencing the Compliance Arrangements; and failed to ensure that industry funding levies applicable to her licence were paid on time; is likely to contravene credit legislation because she demonstrated a lack of: honesty and integrity by submitting documents containing false statements to ASIC; and understanding of her obligations under the credit legislation as an Australian credit licensee and did not demonstrate how she would address her lack of understanding. Ms Trieu’s banning and licence cancellation took effect on 8 December 2025. Ms Trieu has the right to appeal to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of ASIC’s decision. Background Ms Trieu was the sole fit and proper person and responsible manager under her credit licence. ASIC maintains a register that provides information about people who have been disqualified from: involvement in the management of a corporation, auditing self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs), or practising in the financial services or credit industry.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC has obtained commitments from ASX Group (ASX) on a package of reforms including: Strengthening the independence and governance of ASX’s Clearing and Settlement Facilities Boards A strategic reset of ASX’s transformation program ‘Accelerate’, with clear milestones and accountability for delivery The imposition of an additional $150 million capital charge on ASX Limited to ensure ASX maintains robust financial resources until remediation is complete A commitment to stronger leadership In addition, ASIC and the RBA will step up their review to uplift their joint supervisory model. The package will strengthen confidence in ASX and Australia’s critical market infrastructure, provides certainty about the market operator’s reset, and responds to the Interim Report released today by the panel of the Inquiry into the ASX Group. The Inquiry, announced in June 2025 and led by an expert panel, has identified shortcomings in ASX’s governance, capability, risk management and culture that required urgent attention and response. Due to the urgency of the reset required, the insights of the Report were shared with ASIC, and ASIC engaged with ASX. The report finds that, while some progress has been made, more of the same is not an option. The scale of transformation required is significant and cannot be achieved through current tactical, incremental measures or business as usual. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said urgent action was needed to set ASX on the right path. ‘ASX needs to embrace a new era of accountability, investment, and stewardship to increase confidence, and meet the expectations of the market and the Australian public. ‘This package is a circuit-breaker. ‘Many of the problems the report identifies took years to develop, and while there are some immediate actions that will be put in place, the key issues are going to take time and resources to resolve. There are no quick fixes or shortcuts. ‘This reset is about addressing underlying issues, and laying the foundations for a resilient, world-class market operator. ‘This should be a clear signal to the market that ASX are committed to delivering the transformation necessary for resilient and future-ready national market infrastructure.’ Interim Report findings The Inquiry Panel has so far conducted around 140 stakeholder interviews, reviewed written submissions, undertaken international benchmarking with similar entities, held focus groups with ASX staff, and reviewed nearly 10,000 documents. Key findings of the Interim Report include that: ASX’s focus on short-term financial performance and shareholder returns has compromised its obligations to operate critical national market infrastructure ASX’s strategy lacks the vision necessary for the critical role it plays The organisation’s culture is defensive, which limits its ability to deliver meaningful change ASX’s governance structures do not ensure the independence of its Clearing and Settlement subsidiaries and their required levels of investment Existing supervisory practices have not achieved the desired outcomes. Pathway forward In response to the issues raised by the Panel, ASIC has proposed a series of actions to which ASX has agreed that are detailed in the ASIC and ASX letter . Key features of ASX’s commitments include ensuring the Clearing and Settlement (CS) Facility Boards have the right capability, resources and ‘voice’ to deliver on their duties. That means seeing the Boards of the CS Facility Licensees composed of directors who are not directors of an ASX Group company other than the CS Facility Licensees, and the development and implementation of robust, service-level standards for intra-group services provided to CS Facilities. ASX’s ‘Accelerate’ program will be reset with new targets and benchmarking agreed to by ASIC and the RBA, to provide clarity about the purpose of the ASX first and foremost as a critical market infrastructure provider. A capital charge of $150 million will be implemented by 30 June 2027, and held until the agreed work in the new Accelerate program is completed to ASIC’s satisfaction. ASIC will also review its regulatory guidance for market licensees’ financial resource requirements. In addition to ASX’s actions, ASIC and the RBA have also committed to step up their review to uplift the joint supervisory model for the CS Facilities. Mr Longo said, ‘ASIC will ensure ASX’s commitments are delivered in full. We are determined to see lasting change that restores trust and confidence in the ASX and the integrity of Australia’s financial markets. ‘I want to thank the Inquiry Panel for their work to date on this comprehensive review, and their help to outline a path to ensuring the ASX delivers the reliable and future-proof market infrastructure Australia needs.’ The Final Report of the Inquiry is due to be delivered to ASIC by 31 March 2026.

    "full_text": "Date 12 December 2025 Topics Buying and selling products and services Compliance and enforcement Stay protected The Federal Court has found that fashion retailer Fewstone, trading as City Beach, breached the Australian Consumer Law by selling a range of consumer novelty products that did not comply with mandatory button battery safety and information standards. The Court found that between June 2022 and October 2024 City Beach sold more than 60 product types containing button batteries that did not comply with the button battery safety and/or information standards. The products included toys, digital notepads, keyrings, lights and light-up Jibbitz accessories for Crocs shoes. The Court also found that, during this period, City Beach supplied the non-compliant button battery products on more than 54,000 occasions. “We brought this case because we believed the wide array of non-compliant products sold by City Beach exposed consumers to unacceptable safety risks,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “Button batteries are incredibly dangerous for young children, and compliance with Australia’s button battery safety and information standards is critical.” “This decision by the Court should send a strong warning to retailers and manufacturers that supply of consumer goods powered by button batteries which do not comply with the standards risk enforcement action by the ACCC,” Ms Lowe said. This was the first proceeding to be brought by the ACCC for an alleged breach of the button battery safety standards. As well as making declarations, the Court ordered City Beach to implement a consumer law compliance program and undertake advertising as part of its voluntary recall of the products in question. The Court has reserved its decision on penalty and costs. To check if a product has been recalled, visit the ACCC product safety website or contact City Beach . Examples of the recalled products subject to the court proceedings Background The ACCC commenced Federal Court proceedings against City Beach in April 2025. City Beach is a national retailer primarily offering surf and skate consumer goods including clothing, accessories and novelty items. Button batteries pose a significant risk to young children. If swallowed, a button battery can become stuck in a child’s throat and result in serious lifelong injuries or death. Insertion into body parts such as the ears or nose can also lead to serious injuries. In Australia, three children have died from inserting or ingesting button batteries. Children up to 5 years of age are at greatest risk of injury from button batteries. Australia’s mandatory button battery standards , which came into effect in June 2022, aim to reduce the risk of death or serious injury caused by button batteries. The safety standard requires products to have secure battery compartments that are designed to be resistant to being opened by children. This is to prevent children from gaining access to button batteries. The information standard requires safety warnings to be provided with products, including seeking urgent medical advice in certain circumstances.

Green County was fined $405,000 for engaging in unlicensed credit activity and breaching consumer protection provisions. Max Funding was fined $110,000 for engaging in unlicensed credit activity. The Court earlier found Green County and Max Funding, neither of which have ever held an Australian credit licence allowing them to engage in consumer lending, failed to make reasonable inquiries or otherwise establish that the loans provided to the two consumers were business loans. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘Green County and Max Funding failed to properly inquire about the true purpose of loans issued to two vulnerable borrowers. As a result, those borrowers did not benefit from the important protections available under the Credit Code. ‘The matter sends a message to credit providers that relying on business purpose declarations without making reasonable enquiries is not good enough and highlights the ongoing work ASIC is doing as part of our enduring priority to stop misconduct involving a high risk of significant consumer harm.’ In handing down his decision, Justice Shariff said, ‘Although not deliberate conduct, neither Green County nor Max Funding made adequate inquiries to scrutinise the materials they were provided given those materials begged many questions.’ His Honour also noted that ‘the effect of that regulatory regime brings into sharp focus that those lenders who intend to engage in the business of non-Code lending and non-Code credit activity have to exercise considerable care and give attention to the circumstances of each relevant consumer in respect of whom credit is to be advanced.’ Downloads Judgment Orders Background ASIC commenced proceedings in March 2023 ( 23-055MR ) with liability judgment delivered on 15 April 2025 ( 25-060MR ). Businesses that provide consumer credit loans must hold an Australian credit licence. The National Consumer Credit Protection Act (the Credit Act) and the National Credit Code (the Code) impose important obligations to protect consumers, including disclosure requirements, restrictions on fees and interest rates, hardship provisions and free access to independent external dispute resolution services.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email A Victorian man has been sentenced in the County Court of Victoria yesterday to a total of 15 months imprisonment for trading $7.14 million of ASX-listed securities between his own brokerage accounts, despite repeated warnings. Mr Behzad Eghrari, of Vermont South, is to be released forthwith upon entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years. On 13 November 2025, Mr Eghrari pleaded guilty to three market manipulation charges involving Investigator Resources Limited (ASX: IVR), Silver Mines Ltd (ASX: SVL), and Lumos Diagnostics Holdings Ltd (ASX: LDX). In a statement of agreed facts filed with the Court, Mr Eghrari admitted to executing 679 trades between four share trading accounts he controlled between 3 August 2022 and 23 January 2024. His trades accounted for up to 73% of the total daily trading volume in the relevant shares, creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in the market. Mr Eghrari was warned on multiple occasions by one of his brokers, Bell Direct, about his trading activity - through phone calls and order cancellations - but continued to execute such trades. This activity, known as ‘wash trading’, is a form of market manipulation and occurs when an individual or entity executes buy and sell orders for the same financial product without any change in beneficial ownership. ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, ‘Wash trading artificially inflates trading volumes and prices, creating a false impression of genuine market activity, distorting the market. ‘This practise is even more damaging in small-cap securities, where even small trades can trigger significant price swings. ‘Market manipulation in any form can cause significant harm, damaging the integrity of financial markets, disadvantaging honest participants and eroding trust in our financial system.’ Misconduct damaging market integrity, including market manipulation is an enduring enforcement priority for ASIC . The volume of the wash trades ranged from 1 to 700,000 per transaction, with values from $0.05 to $29,587. Mr Eghrari used three Commonwealth Securities Limited (CommSec) brokerage accounts and one Bell Direct account, all in his control, to execute the wash trades. The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP) after an ASIC investigation. Background Mr Eghrari was charged with three counts of market manipulation on 14 March 2025 ( 25-039MR ) contrary to ss1041B(1)(a) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The maximum penalty for each offence is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine the greater of: 4,500 penalty units ($999,000), or Three times the amount gained, or loss avoided by the offence, whichever is higher. In recent years, ASIC has taken enforcement action against market manipulation matters through the CDPP: In April 2024, Henry Heng, founder of listed bottled water company Eneco Refresh, was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for using share trading accounts held in the names of his family to manipulate the Eneco Refresh share price on 24 occasions between 18 December 2020 and 15 December 2021( 24-082MR ), In May 2023, Gabriel Govinda (known online as ‘Fibonarchery’) was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment after pleading guilty to 23 charges of market manipulation ( 23-116MR ), In January 2023, Don Evans was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for conspiring to manipulate Quantum Resources Limited (Quantum) shares with former Quantum director Avrohom Kimelman and corporate consultant Benjamin Cooper ( 23-017MR ). In December 2022, Mr Cooper was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for his role in the conspiracy ( 22-354MR ). In November 2021, Mr Kimelman was sentenced to 18-months’ imprisonment for insider trading and market manipulation offences ( 21-297MR ). Quantum Resources is now known as Nova Minerals Limited. In May 2021, Zhonghan Wu (also known as John Wu), former chief financial officer of Traditional Therapy Clinics Limited was sentenced to an intensive corrections order for one year and 10 months, including a condition he perform 200 hours of community service after pleading guilty to one charge of market manipulation and two fraud charges ( 21-103MR ), In 2018, Stefan Boitcheff was sentenced to one year and nine months’ imprisonment after pleading guilty to two charges of market manipulation related to contracts for difference (CFD) products ( 18-099MR ). All offenders (excluding Mr Wu) were released immediately pursuant to a recognisance release order – a court order requiring a financial bond and a commitment to maintain good behaviour for a specified period of time. This was in addition to each offender agreeing to pay a financial penalty for their crime/s.",

    "full_text": "Date 12 December 2025 Topics Competition and exemptions The ACCC has issued a draft determination proposing to authorise the Australasian Performing Right Association’s (APRA) musical works licensing arrangements for five years, subject to stronger conditions aimed at improving the association’s accountability and transparency. APRA, a collecting society holding performing rights for virtually all musical works played or performed in Australia, has had arrangements authorised in some form for 26 years. APRA’s current authorisation is terminating, and APRA is seeking a further authorisation. As part of the process of considering a new authorisation, the ACCC has consulted widely with relevant stakeholders. If renewed, the Authorisation would enable APRA to continue to act collectively for its member copyright holders, to issue licences and collect revenue from businesses in Australia that broadcast or utilise music in their businesses, and to distribute those royalties and fees to copyright holders. APRA’s members and licensees told the ACCC that APRA lacks transparency in setting licence fees and in distributing royalties to its songwriter members, while the ACCC considers that the exclusivity of the Association’s arrangements significantly increases its market power. “The only option for many businesses that rely on playing music, such as bars and broadcasters, is to obtain and pay for a licence from APRA,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. “As APRA is a near monopoly, there is a greater chance its arrangements could adversely impact these businesses, such as through higher licence fees.

The ACCC also proposes to clarify the range of matters that can be dealt with through the scheme, which will include disputes between APRA’s members. While the ACCC does not have a role in regulating or approving APRA’s actions generally, it does have a role in authorising its arrangements where APRA acts on behalf of potential competitors and would otherwise risk breaching competition laws. The ACCC is seeking submissions on its draft decision, including on the proposed conditions, by 16 February 2026. Further information, including details about how to make a submission, and a copy of APRA’s application for reauthorisation, are available on the ACCC’s Public Register at Australasian Performing Right Association Limited. Note to editors Authorisation provides statutory protection from court action for conduct that might otherwise raise concerns under the competition provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. Broadly, the ACCC may grant an authorisation when it is satisfied that the public benefit from the conduct outweighs any public detriment.

The stevedoring industry’s total real revenue per lift has increased by $21.93 (or 5.5 per cent) in 2024-25 and $68.88 (or 19.4 per cent) since 2019-20, to a historical high of $423.11 per container in 2024-25.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past five years, using real earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) as an example, the stevedoring industry’s real:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>operating profit has increased by $457.8 million (or 130.5%), to a historical high of $808.6 million in 2024-25</li>\n<li>operating profit margin has increased by 14.5 percentage points, to a historical high of 34.8% in 2024-25</li>\n<li>return on average tangible assets has increased by 29.5 percentage points, to a historical high of 45% in 2024-25.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The report also compares the profitability of the stevedoring industry with other companies in the transportation and industrials sectors. It shows the stevedoring industry's profitability in 2024 was higher than the transportation sector across all metrics the ACCC used, and higher than the industrials sector across most metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“These are very high short run returns for an industry with significant spare capacity at ports, stable costs and stable productivity,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.</p>\n\n<p>“Typically, we would expect to see excess terminal capacity placing downward pressure on the stevedores’ prices and short run profits. The fact that stevedores are performing better than they were prior to entry of Hutchison, a time when the industry was operating as a capacity constrained duopoly, raises serious concern about how this market is operating.”</p>\n\n<h2><b>Landside charges the main driver of rising prices and profits</b></h2>\n\n<p>In recent years, stevedores have significantly increased the fees that transport companies have to pay to collect or drop off containers, known as landside charges.</p>\n\n<p>“Over the years, landside charges have gone from a relatively small part of revenue to a major driver of profit for the industry,” Ms Brakey said.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024-25, the stevedoring industry collected almost half (49.5 per cent or $1.15 billion) of its revenue from landside charges.

    "full_text": "Date 12 December 2025 Topics Compliance and enforcement Australia’s stevedores are charging record high prices and making historic profits despite having significant spare capacity in ports and with their costs and productivity remaining relatively stable in recent years, the ACCC’s Container Stevedoring Monitoring Report 2024-25 shows. In 2024-25, stevedoring profits rose for the fifth year in a row, reaching historical highs across most metrics measured by the ACCC. Stevedores are now charging a higher total price per container, in real terms, than at any time since the ACCC began monitoring the container stevedoring industry 27 years ago. The report concludes that a Government policy or regulatory response is likely required to address apparent market failures and improve Australia’s container freight supply chain to the benefit of households and businesses. The ACCC uses total real revenue per container lift as a proxy for the total stevedoring price paid per container. The stevedoring industry’s total real revenue per lift has increased by $21.93 (or 5.5 per cent) in 2024-25 and $68.88 (or 19.4 per cent) since 2019-20, to a historical high of $423.11 per container in 2024-25. Over the past five years, using real earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) as an example, the stevedoring industry’s real: operating profit has increased by $457.8 million (or 130.5%), to a historical high of $808.6 million in 2024-25 operating profit margin has increased by 14.5 percentage points, to a historical high of 34.8% in 2024-25 return on average tangible assets has increased by 29.5 percentage points, to a historical high of 45% in 2024-25. The report also compares the profitability of the stevedoring industry with other companies in the transportation and industrials sectors. It shows the stevedoring industry's profitability in 2024 was higher than the transportation sector across all metrics the ACCC used, and higher than the industrials sector across most metrics. “These are very high short run returns for an industry with significant spare capacity at ports, stable costs and stable productivity,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said. “Typically, we would expect to see excess terminal capacity placing downward pressure on the stevedores’ prices and short run profits. The fact that stevedores are performing better than they were prior to entry of Hutchison, a time when the industry was operating as a capacity constrained duopoly, raises serious concern about how this market is operating.” Landside charges the main driver of rising prices and profits In recent years, stevedores have significantly increased the fees that transport companies have to pay to collect or drop off containers, known as landside charges. “Over the years, landside charges have gone from a relatively small part of revenue to a major driver of profit for the industry,” Ms Brakey said. In 2024-25, the stevedoring industry collected almost half (49.5 per cent or $1.15 billion) of its revenue from landside charges. This is almost equal to the entire investment that the stevedores have made collectively over the past 8 years ($1.25 billion). More than $642 million of the $1.15 billion in landside charges revenue came from terminal access charges alone, which stevedores previously described as infrastructure levies. “The stevedoring industry began to significantly increase terminal access charges in 2017 and since then they’ve collected over $3 billion in terminal access charges,” Ms Brakey said. “We are concerned that stevedores can increase these charges, and thereby their profitability, independent of the underlying market conditions”. “These unavoidable costs land first on trucking companies, who then pass them on to importers and exporters, who have no real way to avoid or negotiate them. With similar charges across terminals and lack of ability or incentives for most importers and exporters to switch stevedores, they cannot influence these costs through competition,” Brakey said. “Targeted reform is likely needed to ensure there are effective competitive constraints on stevedores to support the supply chain. Without it, Australian businesses and households will ultimately pay the price through higher costs.” Stevedoring industry total revenue per lift Background The ACCC has monitored the container stevedoring industry since 1998-99, under a direction from the Australian Government.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA imposes additional licence conditions on HESTA Thursday 11 December 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has imposed additional licence conditions on H.E.S.T Australia Ltd (HESTA) to address concerns regarding HESTA’s risk management and board governance during its recent transition of outsourced administration providers. HESTA is one of Australia’s largest superannuation funds with 1.1 million members and approximately $100 billion in funds under management. The conditions follow the transition of HESTA’s administrative services to a new provider, finalised in June 2025, which resulted in a severe, prolonged disruption to member services and caused direct harm to members. APRA has identified deficiencies in HESTA’s board governance and management of risks which rendered HESTA inadequately prepared to effectively oversee and manage the transition. Under the conditions, HESTA is required to conduct separate independent reviews of its risk management framework and board effectiveness. The reviews will be comprehensive in scope and will consider HESTA’s management of the transition. APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said: “APRA expects trustees to demonstrate strong governance and risk management in their oversight of critical operations and material service providers. That responsibility is further heightened when a service that is critical to members is at risk. “While some disruption is unavoidable when changing service providers, APRA expects that any transitions are well managed and do not result in any unnecessary impact on members ability to access their accounts. APRA’s imposition of licence conditions mean that HESTA is required to take prompt action to address deficiencies. APRA will utilise its powers to hold trustees accountable to meet their obligations to members,” Ms Cole said.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC has issued infringement notices to 12 large proprietary companies for allegedly failing to lodge their FY24 audited financial reports on time. The notices were issued as the result of a three-month surveillance following ASIC’s increased focus on non-lodgement of financial reports by large proprietary companies . All 12 companies, which ASIC issued infringement notices of at least $187,800 each, totalling over $2.2 million, have paid in full. The following companies have paid an infringement notice: Aje Hold Co Pty Ltd Bing Lee Electrics Pty Ltd Bob Jane Corporation Pty Ltd Frank Green Holdings Pty Ltd Harris Scarfe Pty Ltd Global Retail Brands Pty Ltd Grill’d Pty Ltd McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd MJ Bale Group Pty Ltd* Outdoor Supacentre Pty Ltd Pearl Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd White Fox Boutique Pty Ltd *MJ Bale Group paid an infringement notice of $198,000, as its alleged contravention occurred after the penalty unit value increased. Payment of an infringement notice does not constitute an admission of guilt or liability. The specific reasons for ASIC’s concerns are set out in the infringement notice on the Infringement Notices Register . For all companies that have paid the infringement notice but have outstanding financial reports, ASIC’s investigation remains open. ASIC’s focus on non-lodgement of financial reports As part of its surveillance, ASIC examined a range of data sources to identify companies with significant revenue, assets or large numbers of employees that had not lodged financial reports. ASIC engaged with 217 companies and alleges that 70% (151) were non-compliant for failing to lodge a financial report for one or more financial years FY23 and/or FY24. Following ASIC’s queries, 103 companies lodged financial reports (see Table 1) and a further 41 are in the process of doing so. ASIC prioritised engagement with larger, more material companies and queried whether they met financial reporting thresholds for FY23 and/or FY24. ASIC also contacted companies that had received an auditor breach report for non-lodgement of financial reports. ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke said: ‘Large proprietary companies are legally obliged to provide financial reports to ensure that those dealing with these businesses can make informed decisions. ‘ASIC is concerned by the substantial number of companies that appear to have not met their obligations either by lodging late or failing to lodge at all. ‘ASIC calls on the directors of large proprietary companies and other entities with financial reporting obligations to proactively review their reporting obligations and ensure financial reports are lodged in a timely manner. ‘We also remind auditors of these entities to notify ASIC if they are aware or suspect that a company is not complying with its lodgement obligations,’ said Ms O’Rourke. ASIC intends to take further action against some of the companies that were the subject of the recent surveillance, including some of companies that are still in the process of lodging their financial reports. ASIC’s ongoing work on financial reporting ASIC remains focussed on driving improved compliance by companies and other entities with financial reporting obligations. Financial reports play an important role assisting creditors and other users of the reports in making informed decisions when dealing with large companies. ‘Targeting financial reporting misconduct including failure to lodge financial reports is an ASIC enforcement priority for 2026 . ASIC will continue to monitor and address lodgement failures, including taking regulatory action for ongoing non-compliance,’ said Ms O’Rourke. ‘ASIC intends to undertake further surveillance work relating to the compliance by large proprietary companies and other entities with financial reporting obligations in 2026. ‘We are stepping up enforcement action against financial reporting misconduct and will continue to leverage a range of data sources to identify potential non-compliance, including notifications by auditors,’ she said. Table 1: List of companies [N=103] that lodged an outstanding financial report for one or more financial years (FY23 and/or FY24) following ASIC’s inquiries. The list is mostly large proprietary companies but also includes other types of companies with financial reporting obligations. In some cases, a company may have been undertaking steps to lodge their financial reports before being contacted by ASIC. However, for each company, the lodgement of a financial report for FY23 and/or FY24 came after they were contacted by ASIC as part of the surveillance. The companies provided a range of reasons for this—the inclusion of a company on this list should not be taken as ASIC having broader concerns about the compliance arrangements or culture of the company.

In addition, IAG provides intermediated insurance through brokers, authorised financial representatives, institutions and agents under the CGU and WFI brands. IAG also underwrites insurance products distributed by financial institutions, including Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, People’s Choice Bank and, since 2023, ANZ Bank. The Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) is a Western Australian based member-owned mutual association that provides roadside assistance, general insurance products, and other ancillary services to its members. RACI underwrites motor insurance and home and contents insurance for RAC. RAC distributes other personal lines of general insurance underwritten by third party insurers. Namely, RAC distributes travel insurance underwritten by Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. RAC also has arrangements in place for the supply of health insurance underwritten by HCF, life insurance underwritten by NobleOak Life Limited and pet insurance underwritten by RACQ Insurance (RACQI). The Proposed Acquisition does not involve the acquisition by IAG of RAC's roadside assistance business or its other operations including RAC's auto servicing and repair services, finance, retirement living, home security, batteries, tyres, travel and tourism operations.

Earlier this year, National Australia Bank Limited paid penalties totalling $751,200 for alleged contraventions of the CDR Rules relating to data quality issues. “Banks have now had a few years to understand and implement their CDR obligations,” Ms Lowe said. “This penalty against CBA should serve as a reminder to all CDR participants that failing to comply with the Rules may result in the ACCC taking enforcement action.” CBA to provide redress to consumers and accredited providers CBA cooperated with the investigation and has made several commitments as part of an administrative resolution with the ACCC, including enabling consumer data sharing for remaining Trading Entity Business Name (TEBN) accounts by 19 December 2025 and providing remediation to customers and accredited data recipients affected by the conduct. The remediation includes a goodwill payment to affected business customers who meet the relevant eligibility criteria, and additional payments to business customers who can substantiate further financial and non-financial loss. The remediation program will begin in the week commencing 19 January 2026 and CBA will email affected customers and publish a notice on its website outlining how affected customers can submit remediation claims. For further information on the remediation program, consumers and accredited data recipients should refer to the Open Banking section of CBA’s website. Note to editors The payment of a penalty specified in an infringement notice is not an admission of a contravention of the CDR Rules. The ACCC can issue an infringement notice when it has reasonable grounds to believe a person or business has contravened certain provisions of the CDR Rules. More information on the obligations of data holders can be found in the Compliance guide for data holders . Penalty amounts for infringement notices are calculated by reference to the value of a penalty unit set in the Crimes Act 1914. This value is regularly indexed. It was most recently increased on 7 November 2024. Background The ACCC alleges that CBA failed to provide an Accredited Person Request Service that enabled consumer data sharing for non-individuals whose customer profile was set up with a TEBN in the account holder field to allow accredited data recipients to request data on behalf of these consumers. This prevented affected consumers from utilising the CDR to share their data, limiting the ability of accredited data recipients to deliver products and services to consumers using CDR data and restraining the potential growth of the CDR. The infringement notices relate to CBA’s alleged failure to enable consumer data sharing for four separate consumers whose customer profiles were set up with a TEBN. The CDR gives consumers the right to safely transfer data about themselves from data holders to accredited persons, potentially to access new products and services, including better deals on everyday products and services. The CDR is an economy-wide reform that is being rolled out sector by sector. The CDR has been rolled out to banking (from July 2020) and energy (from November 2022), with the non-bank lending sector to follow from mid-2026. The transfer of consumer data occurs between data holders and accredited persons, or accredited providers. The Australian Government has designed and oversees the system to ensure it is safe and secure for consumers. Accredited providers must go through a rigorous process to become accredited by the Data Recipient Accreditor to provide services to consumers using CDR data. A list of current providers, along with further information about the CDR, is available on the CDR website . The ACCC, together with its co-regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, is responsible for ensuring CDR participants, including accredited providers and data holders, comply with their CDR obligations. The Treasury leads CDR policy, including development of rules and advice to government on which sectors the CDR should apply to in the future. Within Treasury, the Data Standards Body develops the standards that prescribe how data is shared under the CDR.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC has commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Diversa Trustees Limited, alleging failures concerning the First Guardian Master Fund. Around $300 million was invested into First Guardian from 2020 to 2024 through superannuation funds for which Diversa was trustee. ASIC alleges Diversa failed to conduct adequate due diligence before allowing its members to invest and failed to conduct adequate ongoing monitoring. Further, ASIC alleges that Diversa failed to enforce a 50% holding limit it imposed for First Guardian and failed to have systems and processes in place to ensure that there was compliance with that holding limit. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘This is another significant action relating to the First Guardian collapse which is an ongoing enforcement priority for 2026.’ ‘Superannuation trustees must put their members first by acting with care and skill and by carrying out proper checks on investment options made available on their platforms,’ the Deputy Chair said. ASIC alleges that Diversa failed to: exercise the same degree of care, skill and diligence as a prudent superannuation trustee would act in the best financial interests of its members exercise due diligence in developing, offering and reviewing investment options do all things necessary to ensure the financial services covered by its Australian financial services licence were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly. ‘This action furthers ASIC’s commitment to seek compensation for the victims of the Shield and First Guardian collapses wherever possible. Our first priority has been preserving assets for the benefit of investors to the extent they are available, and now we’re taking action to hold those we consider responsible to account with 11 cases underway in the Federal Court against 19 defendants,’ the Deputy Chair said. ASIC is seeking orders for compensation, declarations and civil penalties from the Court. ASIC and APRA continue to work closely together to hold trustees of relevant regulated super funds to account consistent with ASIC and APRA’s respective mandates and legal processes. Background ASIC alleges Diversa contravened s52 and s54B of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) and s912A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Diversa is the trustee of a number of APRA regulated superannuation funds. At different times between July 2020 to July 2024, Diversa was the trustee for the Powerwrap Master Plan, Praemium SMA Superannuation Fund, YourChoice Super and Australian Practical Superannuation. YourChoice and AusPrac were sub-plans of the MAP Master Superannuation Plan prior to 1 December 2020. After 1 December 2020, YourChoice and Ausprac became sub-plans of the OneSuper Fund. In May 2024, Falcon suspended the processing of applications and withdrawals from First Guardian subject to some limited exceptions, to allow for a restructure of the fund and its underlying assets. The suspension was never lifted and in February 2025 ASIC took action to freeze the assets of Falcon Capital Limited and First Guardian ( 25-027MR ). Falcon Capital Limited is currently in liquidation. Ross Blakeley and Paul Harlond of FTI Consulting were appointed as liquidators of Falcon Capital and were directed by the Court to wind up First Guardian. The liquidators issued an updated report to unitholders and creditors on 2 December 2025: FTI Consulting . In April 2025, when the liquidators were ordered to wind up First Guardian, Diversa had approximately $243 million invested in First Guardian, associated with 2,055 superannuation members.

ASIC also claims that Spice Capital and Mr Oxlade raised at least $1.45 million from investors in just six months between February 2024 and July 2024 for purported investments in gold salvage operations from shipwrecks in the Solomon Islands and the refining of high-value mineral sands located on Queensland properties.

    "full_text": "Media Release Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision Number 2025-33 Date 9 December 2025 At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent. While inflation has fallen substantially since its peak in 2022, it has picked up more recently. The Board’s judgement is that some of the recent increase in underlying was due to temporary factors and there is uncertainty about how much signal to take from monthly CPI data given it is a new data series. Nevertheless, the data do suggest some of a more broadly based pick-up in inflation, part of which may be persistent and will close monitoring. Economic activity continues to recover. Growth in private demand has strengthened, driven both consumption and investment. Activity and prices in the housing market are also continuing to pick up. Financial conditions have eased since the beginning of the year, credit is readily available to both households and businesses and the effects of earlier interest rate reductions are yet to flow through fully to demand, prices and wages. On other hand, money market interest rates and government bond yields have risen more recently. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight. The unemployment rate has risen gradually over the past year and employment growth has However, measures of labour underutilisation remain at low rates, surveyed measures of capacity utilisation are above their long-run average and business surveys and liaison continue to suggest that a significant share of firms are experiencing difficulty labour. Wages growth, as measured by the Wage Price Index, has eased from its peak but broader measures of wages continue to show strong growth and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation the extent to which monetary policy remains restrictive. On the domestic side, the in momentum has been stronger than anticipated, particularly in the private sector. If continues, it is likely to add to capacity pressures. Uncertainty in the global economy remains significant but so far there has been minimal impact on overall growth and trade Australia’s major trading partners. Decision The recent data suggest the risks to inflation have tilted to the upside, but it will little longer to assess the persistence of inflationary pressures. Private demand is recovering. Labour market conditions still appear a little tight but further modest is expected. The Board therefore judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

Qantas Group and Virgin Australia’s financial results demonstrate strong passenger demand and lack of domestic competition This quarter’s report analysed the 2024-25 financial results for the Qantas Group and Virgin Australia. Both carriers have sustained three consecutive years of profitable earnings, marking a period of consolidation and strength for the two major airline groups. The Qantas Group’s earnings were largely driven by growth in Qantas’ Loyalty program and the Jetstar arm of its business. Jetstar Domestic recorded 55 per cent growth in earnings since 2023-24, benefiting from strong demand for domestic leisure travel and its position as the only low-cost carrier in Australia.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA consults on formalising a three-tiered approach to proportionality in banking prudential framework Friday 5 December 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has begun consulting on adding a third tier to its prudential framework for banking to embed additional proportionality and drive competition in the industry. As part of the Council of Financial Regulators’ Review into Small and Medium-sized Banks , APRA committed to formalise a three-tiered approach to proportionality in the prudential framework for banking to better support competition from small and medium banks. Under the existing framework, banks 1 are classified as either significant or non-significant financial institutions. Significant financial institutions (SFIs) face additional or heightened requirements in some areas relative to non-SFIs. In a discussion paper published today, APRA has proposed creating a new tier of Most Significant Financial Institutions (MSFIs) for banks with more than $300 billion in assets. This would currently comprise the four major banks and Macquarie Bank. The second tier would cover all other banks that are SFIs, with the SFI threshold raised from $20 billion to $30 billion. The third tier, being non-SFIs, would include all remaining banks. Non-SFIs would be given additional time to comply with new or revised requirements, where appropriate, compared to banks in the other tiers. APRA also recognises that banks move between tiers from time-to-time whether through growth or merger and acquisition. APRA therefore proposes to provide all banks a transition period of at least 12 months to comply with higher prudential settings should they move to a higher tier. APRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said increasing proportionality in the banking framework would support growth, competition and sustainability in banking. “While APRA’s prudential framework is inherently proportionate, with larger, more complex entities subject to heightened requirements, there is an opportunity to give greater certainty and clarity to the industry and reduce impost where appropriate. “By increasing the level of distinction in our prudential framework between banks of different size, scope and complexity, APRA can better ensure that requirements are not overly burdensome relative to what is needed to protect depositors and promote financial stability. “This is one of a number of initiatives APRA is undertaking to enhance proportionality and reduce regulatory burden as part of our continued efforts to support the Government’s drive to lift national productivity. We are also engaging with Treasury on the possibility of creating a fourth tier with reduced requirements for the very smallest banks and will consider whether additional proportionality may be appropriate in superannuation and insurance. “APRA will continue to explore opportunities to more explicitly differentiate prudential requirements and implementation flexibility by tier when we develop a new standard or revise an existing one,” she said. After a three-month consultation period, APRA expects to finalise the proposals in 2026.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC has made an interim stop order preventing Stratos Trading Pty Limited (trading as FXCM) from issuing contracts for difference (CFDs) to retail clients because of deficiencies in its target market determination (TMD). ASIC acted because it was concerned that the TMD inappropriately included investors with a medium risk appetite in the target market for FXCM’s CFDs. ASIC considers that the risks associated with trading FXCM’s CFDs, including leverage, volatility, liquidity and pricing risk, make them unlikely to be suitable for investors who have a ‘medium risk appetite’, regardless of any other investment criteria noted in the TMD. The interim stop order prohibits FXCM from issuing CFDs to retail clients and opening trading accounts for new retail clients to trade in those CFDs. It covers CFDs issued by FXCM that reference the following underling asset classes: currency pairs and forex baskets treasuries and commodities stock indices stocks and stock baskets, and cryptocurrencies. ASIC made the interim order to prevent FXCM from issuing CFDs to retail clients, where distribution of the products is unlikely to be consistent with the financial objectives, situation or needs of consumers in its target market. The order does not prevent FXCM’s existing clients from varying or closing their CFD positions. The order is valid for 21 days unless revoked earlier. Background Under the design and distribution obligations (DDO), financial product issuers must define an appropriate target market for a financial product offered to retail clients, having regard to the risks and features of the product. Issuers also need to consider how their product will be distributed and specify appropriate conditions on distribution conduct so that the product is directed to the target market and is unlikely to be acquired by consumers outside the target market. CFDs are leveraged derivative contracts that allow a client to speculate in the change in value of an underlying asset, such as foreign exchange rates, stock market indices, single equities, commodities or crypto assets. ASIC’s product intervention order for CFDs strengthened consumer protections after reviews in 2017, 2019 and 2020 found that most retail clients lose money trading CFDs (refer 20-254MR ). In April 2022, ASIC extended this order for a further five years to 23 May 2027 (refer 22-082MR ). On 6 September 2023, ASIC released Report 770 Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives ( REP 770 ), outlining how issuers of retail OTC derivatives are meeting DDO and highlighting areas for improvement, including their over-reliance on client questionnaires as a primary distribution filter and making greater use of available data to assist the distribution arrangements. On 10 September 2024, ASIC released REP 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation ( REP 795 ), outlining our key observations on how issuers of high-risk products including CFDs are complying with the reasonable steps obligation and highlighting further areas for improvement.

The regulator is concerned that FXCM's TMD inappropriately includes investors with a medium risk appetite, considering the inherent risks of CFDs. This action underscores ASIC's focus on enforcing Design and Distribution Obligations (DDO) and protecting retail investors from unsuitable financial products.\n*   **Stop Order Issued:** ASIC has placed an interim stop order on FXCM, preventing them from issuing CFDs to retail clients and opening new trading accounts for these products. The order is valid for 21 days unless revoked earlier.\n*   **TMD Deficiency:** The core issue is that FXCM's TMD is deemed too broad, including investors with a \"medium risk appetite\" for CFDs, which ASIC considers unsuitable given their leverage, volatility, and other risks.\n*   **DDO Enforcement:** This action highlights ASIC's commitment to enforcing the DDO, requiring issuers to define appropriate target markets and ensure products are distributed accordingly. The DDO requires financial product issuers to consider how their product will be distributed and specify appropriate conditions on distribution conduct so that the product is directed to the target market and is unlikely to be acquired by consumers outside the target market.\n*   **CFD Risks:** ASIC considers CFDs high-risk products, which is why CFD issuers' compliance with the DDO is under scrutiny.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA finalises changes to phase out Additional Tier 1 capital instruments Thursday 4 December 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has finalised consequential amendments to its bank prudential framework to phase out Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments – also known as hybrid bonds – as eligible regulatory capital. APRA confirmed in December last year its decision to phase out AT1, enabling the benefits of: improved stabilisation in a crisis and reduced contagion risk. International experience has shown that AT1 capital does not fulfil a stabilising function in a crisis due to the complexities of using it and the risk of causing contagion; enhanced proportionality by lowering the cost of capital for smaller banks relative to larger banks; and reduced compliance costs for banks by simplifying the framework and removing a capital instrument that can impose additional design, marketing and issuance costs, particularly for small banks. APRA will allow banks to replace AT1 predominantly with cheaper and more reliable forms of capital that would absorb losses more effectively in times of stress. This will lead to a simpler and more reliable capital framework, with lower costs for smaller banks. Existing AT1 will be phased out gradually to ensure an orderly transition and limit any immediate impacts on issuers or investors. APRA expects all AT1 issued by banks to be phased out by 2032. There will be no changes to the existing legal terms, including subordination, of these outstanding instruments. The main change from the initial proposal is that APRA will set the leverage ratio at 3.25 per cent of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital (rather than 3.5 per cent of CET1). This will maintain the current calibration of the leverage ratio, incorporating industry feedback. APRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said: “This release concludes our multi-year review of AT1, which aimed to address concerns from international experience where AT1 didn’t operate as intended due to the complexity of using it as going concern capital, the potential for legal challenges and the risk of causing contagion. “By phasing out AT1 as eligible bank capital and replacing it with simpler and more effective regulatory capital instruments, the Australian financial system will be more resilient and better able to withstand future shocks. “We look forward to continuing our engagement with industry to support a smooth transition onto the new framework, which comes into effect on 1 January 2027.” APRA has today published a letter to banks that responds to submissions to its consultation on proposed changes to its prudential standards, prudential practice guides and reporting standards to facilitate the phase-out of AT1. The response letter and new prudential standards, prudential practice guides and reporting standards are available at: Improving the effectiveness of Additional Tier 1 capital instruments .

Report 827 Insights from the ASIC Whistleblower Questionnaire: July 2024 to June 2025 ( REP 827 ) benchmarks whistleblower policies and practices across 134 entities in 18 industries, examining how far companies have adopted better practices outlined in previous ASIC publications. ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said: ‘Whistleblowers play a crucial role in identifying and exposing misconduct that can harm customers, shareholders, companies and the broader community. ‘Without effective policies and programs to encourage whistleblowers to come forward, misconduct may otherwise go unreported and undetected,’ he said. ASIC’s questionnaire found significant variation in the maturity of whistleblower practices. There are opportunities for companies to adopt better practices for whistleblower disclosures. ASIC’s review found: over one third of participating entities did not provide a dedicated whistleblower web page for raising concerns a quarter failed to provide regular staff training on their whistleblower program, and more than half had not sought employee feedback on their whistleblower program in the past year. ASIC observed larger companies and companies within the mining sector were most likely to have mature whistleblower practices and higher disclosure rates. Some smaller companies also demonstrated better practices, suggesting firm size was not an impediment to strong whistleblower programs. Commissioner Kirkland said ASIC's review highlighted actions Australian companies could adopt to improve their whistleblower programs and practices. ‘While whistleblower processes need to be tailored to the circumstances of each company, providing dedicated web pages for whistleblower reporting, enabling communication with anonymous disclosers, and fostering a stronger speak-up culture are all steps companies can take to support whistleblowers and encourage disclosures,' said Mr Kirkland. ‘Strong, appropriate and effective whistleblower practices go to the core of good corporate governance. These programs provide important information for directors to oversee their company’s operations and compliance with the law. ‘We encourage companies to benchmark themselves against the findings of the report and consider how they can improve their own whistleblower policies and practices,’ he said. ASIC will continue to monitor whistleblower practices across corporate Australia and engage with companies identified as having non-compliant or significantly less mature practices. Companies are reminded that they are required to provide specific protections for whistleblowers and to manage whistleblower disclosures confidentially. Proper whistleblower policies should reflect these protections and outline how they will support and protect whistleblowers, taking into account the specific circumstances and characteristics of the company. Snapshot: Whistleblower programs in corporate Australia Snapshot Whistleblower programs in corporate Australia - text version Our ASIC Whistleblower Questionnaire findings show: 134 companies received a total of 8,095 disclosures 49 days average time taken to complete an investigation 69% of disclosures were made through a dedicated whistleblower reporting web page or hotline On average 24% of in-scope disclosures that were investigated were ultimately substantiated 42% of companies reported disciplinary action against staff member(s) as the most common outcome Opportunities for improvement: 22% of surveyed companies reported receiving zero disclosures. Companies should consider whether there is trust and awareness of their whistleblower program and whether there are safe and easy ways to make disclosures. 30% of companies do not regularly review the effectiveness of their whistleblower program. Companies are reminded to review their whistleblower policy and consider the operation, outcomes and effectiveness of their whistleblower program. 25% of companies did not provide regular training to staff members about the whistleblower program. Companies should consider providing employees with regular training and information about the whistleblower program to support greater awareness of and confidence in the program. 58% of companies had not sought feedback from employees. Companies should consider seeking feedback from employees about the whistleblower program. This feedback can provide useful insight into employees’ knowledge of and trust in the program, and their willingness to make disclosures if they see wrongdoing.

I would like to begin by confirming to the Committee that Australia’s financial system remains strong and stable with robust levels of financial and operational resilience. This resilience has been built up over many years through APRA’s prudential policy settings and supervision of banks, superannuation trustees and insurers. While Australians can have confidence in the safety of their financial institutions, we cannot afford to be complacent, especially at a time of heightened global uncertainty. In addition to supervising individual banks, insurers and super funds, APRA is constantly scanning the horizon to identify trends and emerging risks in the domestic and international operating environments. While we often provide insights into what we are seeing at a system level in speeches or appearances at forums such as this one, we recently launched a report that delivers a new level of transparency around our perspectives. The new System Risk Outlook report describes what APRA sees as the main risks and vulnerabilities facing the Australian financial system. The risks and vulnerabilities outlined in this first report can be divided into three broad groups. Geopolitical risk is the first concern, which has potential to transmit through the financial system via many channels and trigger multiple disruptive risk events at the same time. To address this, APRA and the other agencies on the Council of Financial Regulators are strengthening the system’s resilience through a dedicated geopolitical risk work program. The second main theme is housing risks , with high household debt identified as a key financial system vulnerability. With interest rates having fallen, the labour market strong and house prices growing robustly, we believe this marks a turning point in the financial cycle that could result in a build-up of housing-related vulnerabilities. These include high debt-to-income and loan-to-valuation ratio borrowing, as well as a pick-up in lending to investors. Last week, we took pre-emptive action to guard against this build-up of housing-related risks by announcing plans to activate limits on high debt-to-income home lending from next February. These limits won’t be immediately binding at a system level, however we are not prepared to wait for risks to continue building before putting appropriate guardrails in place. The third key theme identified by our System Risk Outlook concerns risks associated with interconnectivity and the growing systemic importance of superannuation . To that point, our report included a summary of the key findings from Phase 1 of our inaugural system risk stress test, which is exploring how key risks to the financial system could transmit across industries, particularly between banking and superannuation. The findings indicated that superannuation can act as a stabilising force for the financial system, providing capital support to the banking system, but in some circumstances can amplify vulnerabilities. We will shortly embark on the second phase of the system risk stress test, which will test our initial findings and deliver further insights. The superannuation sector isn’t just important for financial system stability. Its purpose is so Australians can save for retirement and live with dignity once they’ve stopped working. For that reason, APRA closely supervises the industry to ensure trustees are making decisions in the best financial interests of their members. Last week, we jointly released with ASIC the 2025 Retirement Income Covenant (RIC) Pulse Check report, which assesses the progress trustees have made in developing retirement income strategies. Unfortunately, the report finds a growing gap between the trustees actively promoting better retirement outcomes for their members and those that are not. We have joined ASIC in calling on trustees to improve and will be engaging directly with those trustees that are laggards in this area. Like many others, we have also been concerned at the impact the collapse of managed investment schemes First Guardian and Shield has had on thousands of Australians. Although APRA doesn’t regulate these types of investment schemes, we do supervise the superannuation trustees that made them available through their online platform products. Over the past several years, APRA has undertaken significant work to strengthen investment governance practices in superannuation. This includes a review into platform trustees’ onboarding, ongoing due diligence and monitoring of investment options offered to members on their platforms. Our work on this is ongoing. Last month, we wrote to trustees calling on them to accelerate and escalate efforts to safeguard members’ investments held in platforms. We are continuing to take direct supervisory action with the entities concerned with that work, as well as supporting ASIC’s enforcement work in relation to Shield and First Guardian. For those trustees where we have elevated prudential concerns, APRA will engage with the trustees to address these shortcomings, using enforcement tools as appropriate. Finally, I want to touch briefly on the work APRA has been undertaking to ensure we are getting the balance right balance between financial safety and considerations such as competition, efficiency and productivity. Last month, we delivered an update on our eight proposed measures to modernise the prudential framework on governance. After listening carefully to industry feedback, we wrote to industry advising we will modify three of those proposals to ensure they don’t impose undue regulatory constraint on boards. This includes extending a tenure limit for non-executive directors from 10 to 12 years and scrapping a proposed requirement for significant financial institutions to engage early with APRA on responsible person appointments and succession planning. In banking, we have commenced consultation on a more accessible pathway for banks to use the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to calculating credit risk-weighted assets; and in coming days we will begin formal consultation on creating a third tier to our prudential framework for banking to embed additional proportionality and drive competition in the industry. This work on getting the balance right is also ongoing in insurance where we have proposed updates to the reinsurance framework for general insurers to facilitate easier access to different forms of reinsurance. And in life insurance, we are consulting on changes to the capital framework for longevity products, such as annuities, to increase the availability of retirement products. On that note, my fellow APRA Members and I look forward to answering your questions.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry. It oversees banks, mutuals, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, private health insurers, friendly societies, and most members of the superannuation industry. APRA currently supervises institutions holding around $9 trillion in assets for Australian depositors, policyholders and superannuation fund members.",
    "ai_summary": "This statement from the Chair of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in December 2025 highlights the stability of the Australian financial system while also emphasizing emerging risks and APRA's proactive measures to address them. Here are the key takeaways for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Systemic Resilience:** The Australian financial system remains strong and stable, built on APRA's prudential policies and supervision of financial institutions.\n*   **Emerging Risks:** APRA has identified three key areas of concern: geopolitical risk, housing-related vulnerabilities (particularly high household debt), and risks associated with the interconnectivity and growing importance of the superannuation sector. APRA is actively addressing these risks through dedicated programs and stress testing.\n*   **Housing Lending Limits:** APRA is implementing limits on high debt-to-income home lending from next February to proactively manage the build-up of housing-related risks.\n*   **Superannuation Oversight:** APRA and ASIC are jointly addressing shortcomings in trustees' retirement income strategies, focusing on those who are not actively promoting better retirement outcomes for their members. APRA is also strengthening investment governance practices in superannuation platforms.\n*   **Prudential Framework Modernization:** APRA is modifying proposed governance measures to avoid undue regulatory constraints on boards, easing tenure limits for non-executive directors and removing requirements for early engagement on responsible person appointments. APRA is also creating a third tier to the prudential framework for banking to embed additional proportionality and drive competition in the industry.",

    "full_text": "Date 3 December 2025 Topics Mergers and acquisitions The ACCC will not oppose Igneo Infrastructure Partners’ proposed acquisition of Benedict Recycling Pty Ltd, following a change to the transaction addressing the ACCC’s preliminary competition concerns. Igneo manages the infrastructure fund which owns Integrated Waste Services (IWS) and operates under the Recycle Central brand in New South Wales. IWS and Benedict Recycling overlap in the supply of building and demolition (B&D) waste processing services in New South Wales’s Newcastle region. In September 2025, the ACCC expressed strong preliminary competition concerns that the proposed acquisition was likely to substantially lessen competition in the supply of mixed B&D waste processing services in the Newcastle region. “IWS and Benedict Recycling are each other’s closest competitors in the area, and there are limited alternatives to IWS and Benedict Recycling for customers to choose from,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said. “We were concerned that in its original form, the proposed acquisition would have led to higher prices or reduced service quality for those seeking to dispose of mixed B&D waste in the Newcastle region.” After the ACCC’s preliminary concerns were outlined in its Statement of Issues, and following further engagement with the ACCC, the merger parties restructured the transaction to exclude Benedict Recycling’s Newcastle Recycling Centre in Mayfield West, including its assets, staff and equipment, from the transaction. Under the revised transaction, the Newcastle Recycling Centre will be retained by the existing owners of Benedict Recycling, and it will continue to operate as an independent facility for customers such as waste collectors. “Having reviewed this restructured transaction, we are of the view that the proposed acquisition is now unlikely to result in a substantial lessening of competition,” Dr Williams said. More information is available on the ACCC’s public register at Igneo Infrastructure Partners - Benedict Recycling Pty Ltd . Note to editors B&D waste is material generated from the demolition, construction or renovation of residential and commercial buildings, civil projects or infrastructure development. B&D waste is non-putrescible (or ‘solid’), meaning it contains primarily non-organic materials that may or may not be recyclable. Mixed B&D waste is a subcategory of B&D waste which involves materials that have not been segregated. Mixed B&D waste may involve materials such as bricks, concrete, timber, glass, plastic, plasterboard, ceramics, metal, paper and cardboard. Producers of mixed B&D waste typically engage waste collectors to dispose of it. These waste collectors commonly supply skip bins and operate trucks to collect the waste. Background Igneo proposes to acquire 100 per cent of the shares of Benedict Recycling. Prior to this acquisition taking place, the assets, staff and equipment of the Newcastle Recycling Centre will be transferred to a new company which will be owned and operated by the current owners of Benedict Recycling. Igneo is an unlisted infrastructure asset management business of the First Sentier Investors Group, an Australian asset manager with more than $222 billion in funds under management (as at 30 June 2024). First Sentier Investors Group is ultimately owned by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Igneo manages an infrastructure fund that owns IWS, a waste management business with operations in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales. IWS provides a range of waste management services including resource recovery, commercial composting, and disposal. IWS owns Recycle Central Group (Recycle Central), a waste management business that provides waste collection, disposal and processing services for B&D and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste. Recycle Central operates two facilities in Greater Newcastle: a large-scale waste processing facility, located in Kurri Kurri, 38 km from the Newcastle CBD; and a waste transfer station located in Cardiff (in central Newcastle). In the Newcastle region, Recycle Central offers collection services under the brands ‘Central Skips’ and ‘Rentaskip’. Benedict Recycling provides waste disposal and processing services for B&D, C&I, household and green waste across Greater Sydney (Belrose, Chipping Norton and Smeaton Grange), Bowral, Unanderra and Newcastle. In Newcastle, Benedict Recycling operates a processing facility in Mayfield West, close to the centre of Newcastle. Benedict Recycling does not operate a waste collection business.

    "ai_summary": "Here's a summary of the article, focusing on key information for compliance officers and business executives:\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initially raised concerns about Igneo Infrastructure Partners' proposed acquisition of Benedict Recycling due to potential anti-competitive effects in the Newcastle region's building and demolition (B&D) waste processing market. However, the ACCC will no longer oppose the acquisition following a restructuring of the transaction.\nHere are the key takeaways:\n*   **Initial Concerns:** The ACCC was initially concerned that the acquisition would substantially lessen competition in the supply of mixed B&D waste processing services in the Newcastle region, as Igneo's existing business, Integrated Waste Services (IWS), and Benedict Recycling were each other's closest competitors.\n*   **Transaction Restructure:** To address the ACCC's concerns, the transaction was restructured to exclude Benedict Recycling’s Newcastle Recycling Centre in Mayfield West from the acquisition. The Newcastle Recycling Centre, including its assets, staff and equipment, will be retained by the existing owners of Benedict Recycling and operate independently.\n*   **ACCC Clearance:** Following the restructure, the ACCC determined that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to result in a substantial lessening of competition.\n*   **Market Definition:** The ACCC's review focused on the supply of mixed B&D waste processing services, highlighting the importance of understanding specific market segments in merger assessments.\n*   **Compliance Implication:** This case demonstrates the ACCC's scrutiny of mergers within the waste management industry, especially where there is significant market overlap and potential for reduced competition. Companies considering acquisitions in concentrated markets should anticipate thorough regulatory review and be prepared to address potential competition concerns through structural remedies.",

    "risk_rationale": "The ACCC's initial concerns regarding substantial lessening of competition in the Newcastle region (mixed B&D waste processing) indicate a moderate impact. The restructured transaction, requiring Benedict Recycling to retain its Newcastle Recycling Centre, mitigates the initial high risk.

The Court proceedings were brought by the ACCC. The understandings, which were in place between December 2019 and March 2021, required Telstra and Optus to only pre-install Google Search on Android phones they sold to consumers, and not other search engines. In return, Telstra and Optus received a share of the revenue Google generated from ads displayed to consumers when they used Google Search on their Android phones. Google cooperated with the ACCC and admitted that it had engaged in anti-competitive conduct that had the likely effect of substantially lessening competition and also made joint submissions with the ACCC in relation to penalties. “This penalty should send a strong message to all businesses that there are serious and costly consequences for engaging in anti-competitive conduct,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. “Our market economy is predicated on businesses competing freely with each other, which is why locking out competing businesses in a way that substantially lessens competition is illegal.” In addition to the $55m in penalties imposed by the Court, on 18 August 2025 Google and the US-based Google LLC provided the ACCC with a court-enforceable undertaking in which they committed to removing certain pre-installation and default search engine restrictions from Google's contracts with Android phone manufacturers and telcos.

Ownership of the AFS Licence changed in 2023 following the sale of the shares in FFA and the key person and responsible manager also ceased at this time. ASIC found that when the key person and responsible manager on the AFS Licence ceased, FFA failed to apply to ASIC to vary its AFS Licence within five days as required by its AFS Licence conditions. As a result, FFA provided financial services for more than two years without a key person. By continuing to provide financial services after the cessation of the key person, FFA appears to have failed to comply with the obligation to maintain the competence to provide the financial services under the licence. ASIC also found that FFA was unaware of the breach until ASIC made enquiries of the licensee. The key person condition is an important regulatory safeguard. Key person conditions are imposed on an AFS Licence where ASIC considers a licensee is heavily dependent on the competence of one or two responsible managers in the provision of the financial services. AFS Licensees must ensure they are always aware of the conditions on their licence and ensure they operate according to those conditions.

This follows a targeted review of superannuation investment disclosure requirements announced in August 2025. What ASIC is proposing: Stamp duty disclosure changes: ASIC is proposing stamp duty be disclosed as an average amount over seven years, rather than an annual sum, in fees and costs summaries. The proposal would require a change to ASIC Corporations (Disclosure of Fees and Costs) Instrument 2019/1070 ( Instrument 2019/1070 ). Private debt transparency: Class order relief for superannuation trustees, aligning portfolio holdings disclosure obligations for internally-managed private debt with externally-managed private debt. ASIC convened a working group, including representatives from superannuation funds, the investment management sector, consumer advocates, and government and regulatory bodies. The group met twice, once in September and once in October 2025, to provide ASIC with expert advice on whether disclosure settings were causing distortions to investment decisions. This next step will help gather wider sector feedback on the proposals. ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant, who led the review, said ASIC’s proposals responded to feedback from the Treasurer’s Investor Roundtable in August 2025. ‘The proposals are about promoting regulatory balance and addressing problems without compromising on essential disclosure for consumers,’ Commissioner Constant said. ‘The proposed approach promotes transparency and disclosure outcomes that can inform good consumer investment allocation decisions. We thank the working group members for their time on this,’ she said. An alternative that was put forward by some stakeholders is for stamp duty to be removed as a transaction cost. While ASIC has heard the issues and challenges related to stamp duty disclosure, there are a range of other fees and costs that stakeholders have advocated for ASIC to reconsider. That is why ASIC is also committing to bringing forward, and conducting in a timely manner, a broader review of Regulatory Guide 97 Disclosing fees and costs in PDSs and periodic statements ( RG 97 ) to the 2026-27 financial year to ensure guidance remains robust and relevant for industry and Australian consumers.

ASIC is reviewing whether these rules influence investment decisions or conflict with the goals of Australia’s superannuation system.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA to limit high debt-to-income home loans to constrain riskier lending Thursday 27 November 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) will limit high debt-to-income (DTI) home lending to pre-emptively contain a build-up of housing-related vulnerabilities in the financial system. While overall bank lending standards remain sound, APRA has observed a pick-up in some riskier forms of lending over recent months as interest rates have fallen, housing credit growth has picked up to above its longer-term average and housing prices have risen further. Combined with a resilient labour market, these trends suggest a shift in the financial risk cycle and a potential build-up of vulnerabilities that could undermine banking sector and household financial resilience if left unchecked. In particular, high DTI lending has started to pick up, albeit from a low base, driven by high DTI loans to investors. This is expected to increase further in this part of the cycle, and already high household indebtedness could increase further. Given these dynamics, APRA is acting now to contain the potential build-up of housing-related risks from high DTI lending by activating a DTI lending limit, with support from the Council of Financial Regulators. From 1 February next year, the limit on home loans will allow authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) to lend up to 20 per cent of their new mortgage lending at debt of six times income or more. The limit will apply separately to ADIs’ owner-occupier and investor lending. At an aggregate level the limit is not currently binding, so it is not expected to have a near-term impact on borrowers’ access to credit. Only a small number of ADIs are expected to be near the limit for high DTI investor lending at this stage. Should levels of high DTI lending rise towards the 20 per cent limit over the coming period, this limit will act as a guardrail and is expected to have greater impact on investors, who typically borrow at higher DTI ratios than owner-occupiers. Chair John Lonsdale said APRA is not prepared to wait for housing-related vulnerabilities to build up before acting. “APRA’s macroprudential policy tools are designed to mitigate financial stability risks at a system-level. One of the key structural risks to system stability that APRA has long been concerned about is high household indebtedness. Rising indebtedness has in the past often been associated with an increase in riskier lending and rapid growth in property prices. “At this point, the signs of a build-up in risks are chiefly concentrated in high DTI lending, especially to investors. By activating a DTI limit now, APRA aims to pre-emptively contain risks building up from this type of lending and strengthen banking and household sector resilience. “While strong investor activity can amplify housing lending and price cycles that can impact financial stability, we are not yet seeing signs of the broad-based build-up of housing vulnerabilities including a deterioration in lending standards that we have seen in previous episodes of strong investor activity. “Although broader risks are contained, we have seen in the past that they can build rapidly when interest rates are low or declining, borrowers extend themselves and competition among banks for new mortgage lending intensifies, which can lead to easing lending standards. We will consider additional limits, including investor-specific limits, if we see macro-financial risks significantly rising or a deterioration in lending standards,” Mr Lonsdale said. APRA’s DTI limit excludes bridging loans for owner-occupiers and loans for the purchase or construction of new dwellings. This will enable the smooth functioning of property transactions and avoid constraining incentives for the supply of new housing. While the lending limit will apply to all ADIs, there will be some proportionate treatment for smaller ADIs. APRA’s other active macroprudential policy tools, the mortgage serviceability buffer and counter-cyclical capital buffer, remain steady at three per cent and one per cent of risk-weighted assets, respectively. The information paper outlining today’s decision and the accompanying letter are available on the APRA website: Information paper: Activating debt-to-income limits as a macroprudential policy tool Letter: Activation of debt-to-income limits as a macroprudential policy tool Media enquiries Contact APRA Media Unit, on +61 2 9210 3636 All other enquiries For more information contact APRA on 1300 558 849 .

ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘We consider these actions to be serious breaches of the Court’s orders, undermining the asset preservation regime and the administration of justice. ‘Breaching freezing orders and failing to disclose other interests impedes the efforts of ASIC, receivers, and liquidators to preserve assets for the benefit of investors,’ the Deputy Chair said. The freezing orders were made by the Federal Court in 2024 to preserve assets pending the outcome of ASIC’s case against ALAMMC Developments and related entities. Last month, the Federal Court ordered the remaining ALAMMC Group companies be wound up on just and equitable grounds over significant concerns identified by the Court-appointed receivers about investor funds and the viability of the businesses ( 25-236MR ). ASIC has filed the application seeking leave to commence contempt proceedings against Mr McWilliams and Ms Fullarton with the Federal Court. Background The freezing orders were made by the Federal Court on 11 September 2024 and subsequently extended and varied, to preserve assets in connection with ASIC’s enforcement action against ALAMMC Developments Pty Ltd and related parties. The Receivers and Managers have provided detailed evidence of the alleged breaches in the Fourteenth Affidavit of Andrew Peter Fielding, filed 4 September 2025. For further information see ALAMMC Developments .",
    "ai_summary": "ASIC has initiated contempt of court proceedings against David McWilliams and Laura Fullarton, directors of the ALAMMC Group, alleging breaches of freezing orders issued by the Federal Court in 2024. The allegations involve the movement of funds from frozen accounts, failure to disclose assets, and exceeding court-approved living expenses. Here are the key points:\n*   **Alleged Breaches by David McWilliams:** ASIC alleges McWilliams withdrew/moved at least $297,327 from frozen and undisclosed crypto accounts, exceeding his living expenses allowance by $131,566 to $173,026. He also allegedly failed to disclose interests in racehorses, a crypto account, and other bank accounts, and diverted racehorse prize money to his son's account.\n*   **Alleged Breaches by Laura Fullarton:** ASIC alleges Fullarton withdrew/moved at least $245,159 from frozen bank accounts, exceeding her living expenses allowance by $54,760 to $113,270.\n*   **Context of Freezing Orders:** The freezing orders were issued in 2024 to preserve assets related to ASIC's ongoing case against ALAMMC Developments and related entities, which were later ordered to be wound up.\n*   **ASIC's Stance:** ASIC considers the alleged actions serious breaches that undermine asset preservation and the administration of justice, impeding efforts to protect investor assets.",

The report highlights that despite RIC obligations being introduced over three years ago on 1 July 2022, the gap is widening between trustees actively promoting better retirement outcomes for their members and those that are not. While some trustees have shown leadership by investing significant effort to meet the needs of their members transitioning to and in retirement, with some innovating and driving best practice, far too many have been content with making only incremental improvements. APRA and ASIC again call on industry to lift its focus on improving retirement outcomes for their members. All trustees should take steps to meet better practices as outlined in the report. ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said the over 1.5 million Australians already in retirement and the wave of 2.5 million entering retirement over the next decade, deserve better from their superannuation trustees. ‘Super trustees have had three years to develop meaningful retirement income strategies that meet the diverse needs of their members – and meet the law,’ she said. 'Retirees collectively entrust almost $600 billion in savings to the stewardship of super trustees, who should uphold their confidence by focusing on retirement strategies that meet their customer needs. This will become ever more important as the waves of retirement continue and with two in five trustees expected to have more than half their members in retirement by 2045.’ APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole noted ‘ASIC and APRA are committed to holding superannuation trustees to account for improving the experience of members approaching and in retirement, in line with the objective of the RIC’. APRA and ASIC will also be providing individual feedback to trustees. Background On 1 July 2022, the retirement income covenant (covenant) under the Supervision Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act) commenced. These reforms were introduced to improve the retirement outcomes of individuals by placing specific obligations on trustees to consider the needs of beneficiaries (i.e. their members) in retirement. The covenant requires trustees to develop a retirement income strategy for members who are retired or are approaching retirement. The strategy must address how their members will be assisted in achieving and balancing three objectives, maximising income, managing expected risks and flexible access to funds. Since its introduction, ASIC and APRA have reviewed how trustees have responded to the covenant, and where available, shared examples of better practice and areas of focus, with the aim of uplifting industry practice. ASIC recently published findings from a thematic review of retirement income communications and will continue to update ASIC’s Moneysmart content pages, tools and calculators, with actionable guidance for consumers on superannuation and retirement. ASIC and APRA will continue to engage with Treasury in relation to Government’s retirement phase initiatives, including the proposed Best Practice Principles for Retirement Income Solutions and the Retirement Reporting Framework.

ASIC alleges that between June 2024 and January 2025 Mr Convery continued to act as an SMSF auditor despite knowing that he was disqualified. Further, ASIC alleges that between July 2024 and January 2025, Mr Convery created a series of false documents, namely a letter and 47 SMSF Audit reports, for the purposes of them being accepted as genuine by other parties or for obtaining a gain. The matter had its first appearance in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 26 November 2025 and was listed for further mention on 4 March 2026. This matter is being prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP) following a referral from ASIC. Background The maximum penalty for making a false document with the intention it be accepted as genuine carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.

    "full_text": "Media Release Payments System Board Update: November 2025 Meeting Number 2025-32 Date 26 November 2025 At its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including: Financial market infrastructure regulatory reforms and resolution planning. The Board welcomed progress in operationalising powers to prevent or resolve a crisis at an Australian clearing and settlement facility. The Board discussed stakeholder feedback on draft guidance on the RBA’s crisis resolution powers. The guidance is expected to be published in December 2025. Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging. Members discussed the stakeholder feedback and evidence received in response to the Consultation Paper published in July. In particular, the Board considered the relative merits of the various options on payment card surcharging. Members also discussed the extent to which interchange caps should be reduced, and whether commercial credit cards should attract higher interchange caps than consumer credit cards. Members noted feedback that there is a risk that a portion of the proposed interchange reductions would not be passed through to merchants in the short term without further regulatory intervention. As such, members discussed various options to promote competition and transparency in the acquiring market. After giving due consideration to the substantial body of information received during the consultation, the Board expects to publish its conclusions and an implementation timeline for any regulatory action by March 2026. The Board agreed that it was not in the public interest to further delay this review given the importance of the reforms being considered. Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 : Members welcomed the recent amendments to the PSRA. There will be a public consultation in mid 2026 on the Board’s regulatory priorities, taking into account these amendments, technology development and innovation in the payments industry, and payments regulatory issues that extend beyond the Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging. The consultation would include efficiency, competitiveness and safety issues with mobile wallets, three party schemes, buy-now-pay-later providers and e-commerce platforms. Assessment of the New Payments Platform . The Board reviewed the RBA’s 2025 assessment of the New Payments Platform (NPP) under the Prominent Payment Systems oversight regime . Efforts to promote effective governance and risk management remain a priority in light of industry’s intended migration of account-to-account payments to the NPP in the medium term. The safety and resilience of Australia’s real-time gross settlement system . The Board received an update on progress against the recommendations from the March 2024 Assessment of the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS). The update covered initiatives to strengthen the operational reliability of the RITS ecosystem and key areas of oversight focus including change management and cyber resilience. The Board acknowledged the continued progress and noted that the forthcoming full assessment in June 2026 will provide a comprehensive view of RITS’s observance of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The Board received an update on industry progress to enable the transition to AES for card payments in Australia. Members reiterated their strong support for industry efforts to ensure encryption standards continue to meet the high safety standards for card payments expected by the Australian public. The Board expects industry to progress migration with sufficient urgency to enable the readiness of AES for use by December 2030. The Board agreed to consult on using the RBA’s standard-setting powers under the PSRA to support the migration. The annual review of compliance with card payments regulation. Members reviewed the compliance of card issuers and acquirers, and the designated card schemes, with the RBA’s interchange and surcharging standards and access regimes in 2024/25 . There was assessed to be a high level of compliance with the RBA’s regulations. Enhancing cross-border payments. Members discussed Australia’s progress towards achieving cheaper, faster, more transparent and more accessible cross-border payments under the G20 Roadmap. The Board recognised the payments industry’s ongoing efforts to transition to richer ISO 20022 payments messaging and adopt internationally harmonised requirements in the High Value Clearing System and the NPP by the end of 2027. It also observed growing use of the NPP’s International Payments Service, which enables incoming cross-border payments to be processed on a 24/7 basis. The Board will continue to monitor the industry’s implementation of these initiatives. The RBA is currently participating in the second phase of the Bank for International Settlement’s Project Mandala, which is investigating the automation of cross-border compliance processes. 1 The RBA will also be examining options for enhancing wholesale cross-border payments in 2026, including through upgrades to RITS and further research on digital money innovations.

LTT provides coaching and training services online to retail and wholesale clients in relation to trading on margin foreign exchange contracts or contracts for difference. ASIC was concerned that LTT failed to comply with a number of its obligations as an AFS licensee requiring certain financial documents and notifications to be lodged with ASIC under financial services law and AFS licence conditions. In particular, for the financial years ending 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2024, LTT failed to lodge its annual financial statement and audit report within the prescribed timeframe and in compliance with its AFS licence conditions. Further, LTT has been late in lodging the required annual financial statements and audit reports on multiple occasions since 2012, causing ASIC to conclude that, in the future, LTT was likely to continue contravening its obligations under financial services laws. LTT also failed to notify ASIC of the appointment of a new auditor. Compliance with the financial reporting and notification obligations is important to allow ASIC to monitor the AFS licensee’s financial health on a timely basis and ensure the licensee is solvent and can demonstrate they continue to meet the ongoing financial requirements stipulated in their licence conditions. The auditor notification updates the AFS licensee register for the appointed auditor, allowing both internal and external stakeholders to know who is responsible for the licensee’s audit. ASIC has taken the significant step of imposing an additional condition on the AFS licence of LTT requiring it to appoint an independent compliance consultant to review and assess LTT’s procedures for ensuring that it lodges an auditor’s report and financial statements as required under its licence conditions within the prescribed timeframe. The consultant is also to consider LTT’s procedures and frameworks for monitoring its compliance with the financial services laws, for identifying and reporting breaches and other relevant policies and procedures. The consultant must provide two reports on these matters to ASIC so ASIC can assess whether LTT is likely to comply with its obligations in the future or whether further action may be warranted.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC has made an interim stop order preventing City Finance Lending Pty Ltd ( City Finance Lending ) from issuing its small amount credit contract ( SACC ) product to retail clients because of deficiencies in its target market determination ( TMD ). City Finance Lending’s SACC product allows consumers to borrow up to $2,000 for personal purposes ‘to meet an unexpected expense or to make a discretionary expense and who meets [City Finance’s] eligibility criteria.’ ASIC is concerned that the TMD for City Finance Lending’s SACC may be deficient in several key areas. First, the TMD may fail to appropriately define the target market for the SACC product in that it may not adequately: define what an ‘acceptable’ source of income is specify which potential customers require credit for an unacceptable purpose, and specify which potential customers are excluded from the target market for the SACC product on the basis that they do not have financial capacity to repay the principal, repayment and fees. Second, the TMD may be inconsistent with the likely objectives, financial situation and needs of a retail client, as statements made in the TMD as to minimum amounts borrowed are inconsistent with statements made on City Finance Lending’s website. Finally, City Finance Lending’s TMD may not contain appropriate distribution conditions to ensure the product is directed towards the target market. In particular, the distribution conditions may not: contain details as to how SACCs can only be issued to customers within the target market specify what information will be obtained from potential customers or third parties to establish whether they are in the target market specify how such information will be obtained from potential customers or other parties specify how such information will be used by City Finance Lending to decide whether or not the customers is within the target market, and explain what controls are in place within City Finance Lending’s origination and approval system to ensure that the product is likely to reach customers within the target market. ASIC made the interim order to protect consumers from obtaining and using SACCs that potentially may not be suitable for their financial objectives, situation, or needs. The order is valid for 21 days unless revoked earlier. Background City Finance Lending is a credit provider of small and medium amount credit contracts, with an Australian Credit Licence number 469854. On 13 March 2025, ASIC published REP 805 . This report highlights ASIC’s ongoing concerns and work in the small credit industry. Recent action taken by ASIC in the small credit sector includes: current civil penalty proceedings against Ausfinancial Pty Ltd, trading as Swoosh Finance, for alleged breaches of its responsible lending obligations and alleged contraventions of certain design and distribution obligations ( 24-285MR ) securing of $16 million in penalties against Ferratum Australia Pty Ltd (in liquidation) for a number of contraventions of the National Credit Act including entering contracts which imposed prohibited fees ( 24-141MR ), and Federal Court action against Sunshine Loans Pty Ltd for charging an amendment or rescheduling fee not permitted by the National Credit Code ( 25-046MR ). The Design and Distribution obligations ( DDO ) regime commenced on 5 October 2021 and requires issuers and distributors of financial products to adopt a consumer-centric focus in designing, marketing and distributing financial products, and to distribute those products in a more targeted manner. A target market determination is a mandatory public document that sets out the class of consumers a financial product is likely to be appropriate for (target market) and matters relevant to the product’s distribution and review.

The penalty has been imposed against United Super Pty Ltd, the trustee of the Construction and Building Unions Superannuation Fund ( Cbus ), following admissions by Cbus that serious failures caused delays in processing death benefits and total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance claims and impacted more than 7,000 Australians in distressing situations. The penalty exceeds the $18.5m in revenue United Super declared in the 2024 financial year. The penalties come on top of Cbus’s own remediation program to pay approximately $32 million in compensation to the estimated 7,402 affected claimants and members for lost earnings and wrongfully charged fees. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said Cbus's failures needlessly exacerbated the distress of people who were already in upsetting situations. “Thousands of Australians suffered real and avoidable harm because of long delays and systemic failures in the way Cbus handled important and sensitive insurance claims,” said Ms Court. “When people were grieving the loss of a loved one or grappling with a life-altering injury, Cbus should have ensured timely and accurate decisions were made on their insurance claims.” “Not only was Cbus aware of increased insurance claim volumes, but it was also put on notice by its own customers who were complaining about the long delays they were enduring.” “This outcome underscores a message to the whole industry to get it right, especially when your members need it most. You cannot outsource your obligations to your members.” “ASIC has increased its scrutiny of claims handling and member services failures, which are both ASIC enforcement priorities, The sector should be on notice that ASIC is sharpening its focus,” the Deputy Chair said. In delivering his judgment, Justice O'Callaghan noted that, “Delays in the payment of benefits under insurance products can have serious and unacceptable consequences for affected members and claimants.” His Honour noted one case in which the widow of a Cbus member called into ABC radio in June 2023 to highlight a 15-month delay processing her late husband's death benefit claim. After she complained to the media about ongoing poor service, including a lack of communication and extensive periods on hold, Cbus commenced an investigation that led to the breach report to ASIC. His Honour said, “As at 30 June 2024, the Fund was ranked the ninth largest superannuation fund in Australia, and in the 2024 financial year the Fund had over $95 billion in total assets. As one of Australia's largest superannuation funds, it ought to have had more robust processes and systems in place to ensure compliance with key legislative obligations, and to prevent, promptly identify, and correct repeated individual and collective human errors resulting in failures to process claims within a reasonable timeframe.” Between October 2022 and November 2024, Cbus outsourced its claims processing to Australian Administration Service Pty Limited (AAS). However, His Honour further observed, “United Super was ultimately responsible for the outsourcing of material business activity and, from at least November 2022, various United Super executive and board committees were aware that AAS had not met its agreed service levels in relation to the processing of claims.” The Court found that between 27 March 2023 and 1 May 2023, as a percentage of all open claims, between 48% and 56% of all death claims (numbering between 438 and 479 claims) had been open for more than 365 days, and between 38% and 43% of all TPD claims (numbering between 391 and 409 claims) had been open for more than 365 days. The Court declared that Cbus contravened the Corporations Act by failing to do all things necessary to ensure Death, terminal illness and TPD claims ( Claims ) were handled efficiently, honestly and fairly by failing to: take all reasonable steps to ensure Claims were being processed in a reasonable period of time ensure that it held accurate and complete data necessary to determine the volume and age of all Claims ensure the relevant committees had sufficient oversight over issues with processing Claims, and adequately monitor and manage the administrator’s performance under the Administration Agreement. The Court also found Cbus had contravened the Corporations Act on two further occasions by failing to report the matters to ASIC within the required time frame. Reports were required to be made to ASIC on 3 March 2023 and 20 July 2023, but nothing was reported to ASIC until 5 August 2023. The report was made after criticism had occurred on an ABC Melbourne Radio program. In addition, Cbus was also ordered to pay half a million dollars towards ASIC’s legal costs and undertake a compliance program requiring it to obtain expert reports on whether it now has appropriate systems and processes in place. Download Judgment Background MUFG Pension & Market Services Holdings Limited, is a provider of services in Australia’s superannuation administration industry. It operates through its subsidiaries, including Australian Administration Services Pty Limited ACN 003 429 114 ( AAS ), which offers administrative services to United Super. Since 1 January 2021, United Super has been authorised under its Australian Financial Services licence to provide trustee services, including the handling of claims for Cbus Superannuation Fund. In 2021, United Super engaged AAS under an administration agreement to provide claims handling administration services with respect to Cbus. Those services included communicating with members, obtaining required documentary material and delivering this material to the Trustee and/or Insurer as the case may be. United Super self-reported the delays in processing claims to ASIC in August 2023. The above investigation was assisted by information received from the Australian Financial Complaints Authority ( AFCA ). AFCA is the external dispute resolution scheme for resolving complaints between consumers (including small businesses) and financial firms in Australia. AFCA is required under law to notify ASIC, APRA or the ATO about certain financial firm contraventions, breaches, failures to give effect to a determination and systemic issues that they become aware of when considering complaints, as appropriate. Further information is contained in Regulatory Guide 267 Oversight of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority ( RG 267 ) Complaints to AFCA about delays in claims handling by superannuation funds more than doubled between the 2022 and 2023 calendar years. Complaints about processing death benefit claims tripled over the same period. ASIC’s Moneysmart website features information that supports Australians in making decisions about insurance.

Phillip Bird of Alexander Heights, WA and Daniel Holmes of Beechboro, WA, were convicted and fined after each pleaded guilty to two charges of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring Sheffield to commit an offence, one offence being the failure to lodge profit and loss statements and balance sheets (together, financial statements) and the second offence being the failure to lodge auditors’ reports. ASIC had alleged that, as Sheffield’s directors, Mr Bird and Mr Holmes failed to take steps to ensure that Sheffield lodged financial statements and auditors’ reports with ASIC for each financial year between 2019 and 2023 inclusive and were aware of the obligation to do so. As the holder of an Australian financial services (AFS) licence, Sheffield is required to lodge financial statements with ASIC within 3 months of the end of each financial year. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘It is important that AFS licensees lodge timely reports with ASIC so that ASIC can monitor their financial health and make sure they meet their financial obligations under law. Financial reporting misconduct is now an enforcement priority for ASIC and we will not hesitate to take action for reporting failures. Today’s decision show that directors can also face individual criminal consequences over their business’s reporting failures.’ The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP). after a referral from ASIC. Mr Bird and Mr Holmes were also each ordered to pay court costs of $268.80. Background Australian financial services (AFS) licensees must have adequate financial resources to provide the financial services covered by their AFS licence and to carry out supervisory arrangements.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA publishes new report on financial system risks Thursday 20 November 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has launched a new report on APRA’s assessment of risks and vulnerabilities facing the Australian financial system. The new System Risk Outlook report, which will be published twice a year, increases transparency around what APRA is seeing in the domestic and international risk environments to inform its regulatory priorities. Key insights from this first publication include: Risks to the Australian financial system from overseas are heightened, and the geopolitical environment is expected to remain volatile for some time. While the system is well-placed to absorb potential shocks from overseas, this resilience could be eroded if institutions are not prepared for a wide range of scenarios. APRA and the other agencies on the Council of Financial Regulators are strengthening the system’s resilience through a dedicated geopolitical risk work program. APRA is closely monitoring any build-up of domestic vulnerabilities, particularly in the housing market, including high household debt. While overall housing lending standards remain sound, APRA is seeing some signs of a pick-up in higher risk lending, particularly high debt-to-income borrowing by investors. The increasing interconnectedness of the financial system has elevated the potential for shocks in one sector to have a system-wide impact. Today’s report also includes a summary of the findings from Phase 1 of APRA’s inaugural system risk stress test, which was undertaken this year with the four major banks and six large superannuation funds. The key findings from Phase 1 suggest that the structural features of super funds mean that the industry acts as an important stabiliser for the system during stress but, in some cases, their actions can also amplify the negative effect of the shock on members and the system. APRA Chair John Lonsdale said: “The insights from our System Risk Outlook report confirm that Australia’s financial system is stable, resilient and well-placed to absorb shocks, but they also emphasise why we can’t be complacent. International political and economic uncertainty remains elevated, which is why APRA is stepping up its focus on geopolitical risk. “Domestically, housing remains a key vulnerability, given high household debt and prices continuing to rise. We are carefully monitoring these risks and ensuring banks are prepared to implement additional macroprudential tools where required to reinforce lending standards.” “Our inaugural system risk stress test is an important addition to APRA’s stress testing regime by helping us better understand how linkages in the financial system could dampen or amplify shocks. We will shortly commence Phase 2 of the exercise, which will test the robustness of the Phase 1 findings and consider other areas of analysis,” Mr Lonsdale said. APRA expects to publish a final detailed report of the findings of the system risk stress test, incorporating Phase 2, in mid-2026.

The inclusion of findings from the system risk stress test (Phase 1) and plans for Phase 2, impacting major banks and super funds, further indicates moderate resource allocation for compliance and potential system adjustments. This falls short of a fundamental shift, but necessitates noticeable adjustments within the financial system.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Two Australian companies in the GFG Alliance group have paid infringement notices of $187,800 each, totalling $375,600, following their alleged failure to lodge audited financial reports for the year ended 30 June 2024 within the statutory timeframe. Liberty Infrabuild Limited and its parent company Liberty Holdings Australia Pty Ltd, own or operate businesses involved in the manufacturing, distribution and processing of steel long products and the recycling of scrap steel in Australia and globally. In the 2024 financial year, the group’s sales revenue was $5.2 billion and the group had liabilities of $2.19 billion (excluding liabilities from related parties). After failing to lodge by 31 October 2024, ASIC commenced inquiries with various GFG Alliance companies. Liberty Infrabuild subsequently lodged its financial report on 23 May 2025 with a qualified audit opinion, and Liberty Holdings Australia lodged on 15 September 2025 with a disclaimer audit opinion. At the ASIC Annual Forum last week, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court announced that financial reporting misconduct, including failure to lodge financial reports, would be an enforcement priority for ASIC in 2026. ‘These reports provide critical information for investors, creditors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. ‘Delays in lodgement undermine market transparency and confidence, particularly where audit reports are modified or subject to disclaimer opinions,’ the Deputy Chair said. Payment of an infringement notice does not constitute an admission of guilt or liability, and the companies are not regarded as having been convicted of the alleged offence. ASIC notes that both companies lodged their FY25 audited financial reports on time. Background GFG Alliance is a global group of businesses in industries including steel, aluminium, and energy. GFG Alliance has significant operations in Australia, including Infrabuild, Whyalla Steelworks in South Australia run by OneSteel Manufacturing Pty Limited (which is currently in voluntary administration), Tahmoor Coal in New South Wales, and Liberty Bell Bay in Tasmania. Separate civil proceedings were commenced in the Supreme Court of NSW in June 2025 against Whyalla Steelworks’ parent Liberty Primary Metals Australia Pty Ltd (now in voluntary administration), Tahmoor Coal Pty Ltd, and Liberty Bell Bay Pty Ltd for their failure to lodge various annual financial reports at the time the proceedings were commenced. The current status of these proceedings are outlined in ASIC’s media release: 25-141MR Three GFG Alliance Group companies ordered to lodge outstanding annual reports with ASIC . Infringement notices ASIC may issue an infringement notice if we believe, on reasonable grounds, that there has been a contravention of an infringement notice provision. A company has an obligation to lodge audited financial reports with ASIC under s319(1) of the Corporations Act and contravention is an offence of strict liability. Based on the applicable penalty units at the time of the alleged offence, the maximum penalty a court can impose is $375,600 for each offence. Strict liability offences in the Corporations Act are infringement notice provisions and are issued at half the maximum penalty that a court could impose for the contravention. More information The specific reasons for ASIC’s concerns are set out in the infringement notice on the Infringement Notices Register .",

Since 2011, 234 Australians have died in quad bike incidents, with men accounting for more than 80 per cent of fatalities, figures from SafeWork Australia show. “Quad bikes pose a serious risk of injury and death because it is easy for them roll over, even at low speeds. When they rollover, riders are often trapped underneath them. These heavy vehicles cause suffocation, head injuries and crush body parts,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. “Most quad bike deaths occur on farms, and men aged over 70 years are statistically the most at-risk age group. More than 20 per cent of fatalities have been males over the age of 70.” Children under 14 make up more than one in ten deaths, while children under 16 make up more than a quarter of all emergency department presentations relating to quad bike injuries. The ACCC’s newly launched safety awareness campaign is warning farmers, partners, parents and carers of the dangers of quad bikes. The ads warn that One ride can change everything and encourages partners, parents and carers to Protect your loved ones. They will appear on online news sites throughout regional Australia, as well as social media platforms, Spotify and on various podcasts. “We want to remind all quad bike users, including parents of children who may be spending time on a farm this summer holiday period, that quad bikes are not toys, they are powerful machines,” Mr Keogh said. “There are three golden rules to follow when riding quad bikes – helmet on, rollover protection fitted and never let children ride adult quad bikes. Use these safety tips to protect your loved ones and family members.\" NSW and Queensland have the highest number of quad bike related injuries and fatalities. Rollovers and collisions are the most likely cause of death from quad bikes across all states, SafeWork Australia figures show. The Consumer Goods (Quad Bikes) Safety Standard was introduced to reduce the risk of injury or fatality caused by quad bikes. It requires new and imported second hand quad bikes to have minimum stability levels, include rollover protection, and display clear safety warnings at the point of sale. “The Safety Standard has resulted in many safer quad bikes being used, but there is likely to still be hundreds of thousands of older bikes without rollover protection in use,” Mr Keogh said. “We urge anyone with an older quad bike to invest in rollover protection. The cost is minimal compared to the cost of serious injury or a fatality.” “The transition to safer quad bike use will take time and continued awareness.” ACCC’s quad bike safety awareness campaign Quad bike safety: Wear a helmet. Use a quad bike with rollover protection/an operator protection device. You can have one fitted on older quad bikes. Never let children ride adult quad bikes, even as passengers. Don’t carry any passengers on quad bikes that are meant for one person. Avoid riding on rough terrain or steep slopes. Prepare safely before every ride: Always tell someone where you are planning to go and when you expect to return. Make sure you are properly trained before you start using your quad bike Wear protective clothing and gear. Besides a helmet, this may include goggles, long sleeves, long pants, boots and gloves.

ASIC has commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Interprac for allegedly failing to ensure its former authorised representatives Venture Egg (a corporate partnership), and Rhys Reilly Pty Ltd (together, Representatives), complied with the best interests obligations and for failing to have adequate risk management systems. Together, these Representatives advised around 6,843 clients to invest around $677 million of their superannuation into Shield and First Guardian. Both funds have now collapsed, leaving people’s superannuation at risk. ASIC alleges Interprac failed to: have in place an adequate process for approving financial products it allowed onto its approved product list, including Shield and First Guardian, and relied entirely on external research to add those funds to its approved investments list for advisers; respond appropriately to the use of lead generators (being Imperial Capital Group Australia Pty Ltd and AGAT Business Pty Ltd (in liquidation)); respond adequately to news that payments had been made to Mr Ferras Merhi’s companies by entities associated with First Guardian and Shield; enforce or maintain a hold on new investments into Shield and First Guardian after Interprac’s Managing Director and Responsible Manager, Garry Crole, acknowledged serious issues with both funds; prevent the use of a ‘negative consent’ practice, which led to some clients’ superannuation being invested in Shield and/or First Guardian without express consent from those clients; respond adequately to significant inflows of investment into Shield and First Guardian; provide adequate responses to client complaints about advice from the Representatives to invest in Shield or First Guardian and instead relied on a ‘template’ response which often failed to consider the appropriateness of the advice; and respond adequately or impose meaningful consequences in response to serious compliance issues, including failings repeatedly identified in audits. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said ‘Interprac’s alleged oversight and compliance failures exposed thousands of Australians to poor advice and significant financial risk. ‘We allege Interprac failed to ensure certain authorised representatives acted in their clients’ best interests, contributing to hundreds of millions of dollars of superannuation being invested in products that were unsuitable, high risk and costly. ‘We allege that no competent financial adviser could have recommended Australians invest large amounts of their superannuation in these funds, and that Interprac – as licensee – should have been alert and responsive to the significant risk this conduct posed to clients, but it failed on many levels,’ the Deputy Chair said. ASIC is seeking declarations, civil penalties, and orders to restrain Interprac from carrying on a financial services business. Background Effective 31 May 2025, Mr Ferras Merhi and Venture Egg are no longer authorised representatives of Interprac. Effective 15 August 2025, Mr Rhys Reilly and Rhys Reilly Pty Ltd are no longer authorised representatives of Interprac.

SQM Research published reports in October 2021, March 2022 and October 2022, that rated the different classes of Shield as “3¾ stars, Favourable”. ASIC alleges that SQM Research: failed to obtain the information it needed to properly assess Shield; failed to properly consider inconsistencies in information it received when preparing its reports about Shield; misrepresented that it had a reasonable basis for giving Shield a “Favourable” rating and had exercised reasonable care and skill in doing so; and made misrepresentations that understated the percentage of funds managed by parties related to Shield and the asset allocation of Shield. ASIC alleges that the SQM Research reports did not accurately depict the standard, quality, value or grade of Shield, and that reflected deficiencies in the processes SQM followed. The SQM Research reports were provided to financial advisers and superannuation trustees who recommended or onboarded Shield. Around 5,800 people invested their superannuation savings into Shield. In many cases, people invested in Shield after receiving advice from financial advisers. These advisers often told investors to roll over their existing superannuation balances into a choice superannuation fund available on a platform which had onboarded Shield. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said the civil penalty proceedings against SQM Research marked the first time the regulator had taken action against a research house. 'Research houses have a responsibility to ensure they obtain the information needed to prepare their reports, take real care and skill in assessing that information and to present that information accurately. ‘We believe research houses are important gatekeepers and form part of a critical line of defence against poor quality investments or unsuitable products. ‘Given the important role research houses play in rating funds and investments, the community is entitled to expect that their reports will be accurate and based on appropriate information and analysis,’ the Deputy Chair said. ASIC is seeking declarations and civil penalties from the Court. Background SQM Research holds an Australian financial services licence and is a provider of research on investment products. ASIC alleges SQM Research contravened s912A(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 and s12DB(1)(a) and 12DB(1)(e) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 . SQM Research charged Keystone Asset Management Ltd (in liq) (the responsible entity of Shield) fees for preparing the research reports. On 5 November 2025, ASIC released Report 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance ( REP 820 ), which highlighted the important function external research houses perform in the funds management sector and that research houses are expected to undertake rigorous due diligence to substantiate any ratings they issue. ASIC’s Regulatory Guide 79 Research report providers: Improving the quality of investment research ( RG 79 ), sets out clear expectations for research houses, emphasising their role as “important gatekeepers in the financial services industry.” The guide highlights that research report providers must ensure the integrity, quality, and transparency of their research, and that their reports are based on objective, verifiable facts and analysis. ASIC’s guidance aims to strengthen confidence in investment research and protect investors from poor-quality advice.

ASIC has sought leave to commence the proceeding to allege serious failings in relation to Imperial’s referral of clients to MWL and the financial advice given by MWL advisers. ASIC will seek to allege that: between May 2022 and February 2024, nine MWL representatives advised at least 556 clients to make initial investments of about $114 million of their superannuation into Shield; MWL failed to take reasonable steps to ensure its representatives acted in the best interests of its clients and provided appropriate advice in respect of recommendations that clients roll over their superannuation to invest into Shield as the pre-selected investment option; MWL failed to ensure its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly and failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest; Imperial, acting as a lead generator, made misleading representations to prospective clients about the standard, quality and benefits of MWL’s financial services and was involved in MWL’s alleged contravention of its obligation to provide financial services efficiently, honestly and fairly; MWL’s director, Nicholas Maikousis, was involved in MWL’s alleged contraventions of its general licensee obligations and its obligation to take reasonable steps to ensure its authorised representatives complied with their best interests and related duties; MWL received advice fees charged to clients for preparing Statements of Advice recommending investment in Shield; Imperial received (through a related entity) approximately $12.8 million in payments from entities associated with Shield for client referrals and the promotion of Shield. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said the superannuation of many Australians was put at risk by the conduct proposed to be alleged in this proceeding. ‘ASIC will seek to allege that MWL and Imperial were involved in a project which resulted in the superannuation of hundreds of Australians being invested into a high-risk scheme,’ the Deputy Chair said. The project allegedly involved Imperial referring prospective clients to MWL for what Imperial represented would be tailored financial advice, but which instead put clients into a pre-selected investment: Shield . ‘Instead of the tailored financial advice that was promised, we will seek to allege MWL provided pre-determined advice that was not in clients’ best interests. ‘Despite Shield having no proven track record, we will seek to allege clients were advised to invest most or almost all of their retirement savings into the fund, irrespective of their individual circumstances,’ the Deputy Chair said. Because MWL is in administration, ASIC’s application to make these allegations is subject to the Court’s approval (or the consent of the Administrators). If allowed to proceed, ASIC will seek declarations and civil penalties against all defendants, and orders disqualifying Mr Maikousis from managing corporations. Actions to consider if you are a client of MWL If you are a client of MWL and have concerns about the conduct of your adviser or the advice you received, you should consider lodging a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority ( AFCA ). AFCA is the external dispute resolution scheme for financial complaints in Australia and must deal with complaints independently and fairly. AFCA’s service is free for consumers. AFCA can be contacted by: calling 1800 931 678 for free (9am – 5pm Melbourne time), or lodging a complaint online on AFCA’s website . AFCA will consider your complaint if it meets the eligibility criteria. Important deadline: In cancelling MWL’s licence, ASIC required MWL to remain a member of AFCA until 25 August 2026 . If you intend to lodge a complaint with AFCA in relation to advice received from MWL you should do so by 25 August 2026 . Background ASIC will seek to allege that MWL contravened ss 912A(1)(a) and (aa), 961K(2) and 961L of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), that Imperial was involved in MWL’s contravention of s 912A(1)(a), that Mr Maikousis was involved in MWL’s contraventions of ss 912A(1)(a) and (aa) and 961L, and that Imperial contravened s 12DB of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth). On 30 September 2025, ASIC was notified that Daniel Juratowitch and Rachel Burdett of Cor Cordis were appointed as joint administrators of MWL as at 29 September 2025. ASIC has cancelled the Australian Financial Services licence of MWL and banned Mr Maikousis from providing financial services for 10 years over conduct in relation to Shield ( 25-181MR ). ASIC has also banned MWL’s responsible manager and six former MWL financial advisers in respect of advice provided in relation to Shield ( 25-180MR , 25-127MR , 25-128MR , 25-146MR , 25-243MR , 25-245MR ). Consumer information ASIC has issued a consumer alert warning amid increasing concerns that people are being enticed to invest their retirement savings into complex and risky schemes ( 25-120MR Consumer alert ).

Here's what compliance officers and business executives need to know:\n*   **Allegations of Misconduct:** ASIC alleges that between May 2022 and February 2024, MWL representatives advised at least 556 clients to invest approximately $114 million of their superannuation into the Shield Master Fund, without ensuring the advice was in their best interests.\n*   **Conflict of Interest & Misleading Representations:** Imperial Capital Group Australia is accused of making misleading representations to clients about the quality of MWL's financial services and receiving approximately $12.8 million in payments from entities associated with Shield for client referrals.\n*   **Director Involvement:** Former MWL director Nicholas Maikousis is alleged to have been involved in MWL's breaches of its general licensee obligations and its duty to ensure representatives acted in clients' best interests.\n*   **AFCA Complaints:** Clients of MWL who have concerns about the advice they received have until August 25, 2026, to lodge a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).\n*   **Past Actions:** ASIC cancelled the Australian Financial Services licence of MWL and banned Mr Maikousis from providing financial services for 10 years over conduct in relation to Shield and banned other MWL financial advisers.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Private credit practices, financial reporting misconduct, insurance complaints and claims handling, and misleading pricing are among a range of new enforcement priorities ASIC has unveiled for 2026. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said ASIC’s 2026 enforcement priorities have been designed to protect consumers from financial harm and uphold the integrity of Australia’s financial markets. ‘We are continuing to deliver strong, visible and active enforcement outcomes. 'We’re doing more investigations, taking more matters to court and securing record penalties. ‘In the last 12 months, we’ve doubled the number of new investigations and nearly doubled the number of new matters filed in court. ‘We’ve also worked hard to increase our criminal prosecutions, and seen lengthy sentences imposed for financial fraud offences,’ the Deputy Chair said. In 2026, ASIC’s new enforcement priorities are: Misleading pricing practices impacting cost of living for Australians Poor private credit practices Financial reporting misconduct including failure to lodge financial reports Claims and complaint handling failures by insurers Continuing our work to hold those responsible to account for the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds Continuing enforcement priorities are: Strengthening investigation and prosecution of insider trading conduct Misconduct exploiting consumers facing financial difficulty including predatory credit practices Unlawful practices seeking to evade small business creditors Holding super trustees to account for member services failures Auditor misconduct ‘Our 2026 enforcement priorities reflect emerging risks like those in private credit, as well as the challenges Australians face while contending with higher living costs. ‘ASIC will zero in on misleading pricing practices in the financial services sector, particularly those that make everyday costs harder for Australians. ‘In line with our increased surveillance across private credit, we won’t hesitate to take enforcement action to stamp out misconduct in the sector so we can support confident and informed participation, investor protection and market integrity. ‘Reliable financial information remains more important than ever, particularly as entities with unlisted assets, such as super funds and private credit funds, play a bigger role in the economy. In 2026, we will step up enforcement action against financial reporting misconduct. Alongside these priorities, more than 40 people are continuing to investigate the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds and, as one of ASIC’s largest and most complex cases ever, it has been elevated to a new, dedicated priority. ‘We have been focused on returning available money to investors and the next stage is holding those responsible to account for the Shield and First Guardian collapses’, the Deputy Chair said. Key enforcement outcomes over the past year include: Proposing $240 million in combined penalties against ANZ which, if imposed by the court, would be the largest penalties ASIC has ever levelled against a single entity. Filing proceedings against Macquarie and accepting a court enforceable undertaking to repay $320 million to affected Shield Master Fund investors. Securing a 14-year prison sentence for West Australian fraudster Chris Marco; the highest sentence imposed by an Australian court in relation to an ASIC criminal investigation. ASIC’s enforcement priorities for 2026 are designed to send a clear and effective signal to the market about where ASIC will focus its resources and expertise. In addition to ASIC’s 2026 enforcement priorities, ASIC’s enduring priorities remain, including protecting First Nations and vulnerable consumers, upholding market integrity, acting against systemic failures, and ensuring a fair, strong, and efficient financial system for all Australians. Background ASIC’s goal is to help all Australians through promoting market integrity and consumer protection in the Australian financial system. We take decisive and high-profile enforcement action to protect consumers, address misconduct, punish wrongdoers, and, importantly, reduce the risk of misconduct in the markets and sectors we regulate.",

    "full_text": "Date 13 November 2025 Topics Mergers and acquisitions The ACCC will not oppose the proposed acquisition of Seven West Media Limited (ASX:SWM) by Southern Cross Media Limited (ASX:SXL). Seven owns and operates free-to-air TV broadcaster the Seven Network, as well as the publishers of The West Australian, the Sunday Times, 11 suburban newspapers and 19 regional publications in Western Australia. Seven does not own any radio licences or assets. Southern Cross operates 104 FM, AM and digital commercial radio stations through the Triple M and HIT brands and holds 88 radio licences in metropolitan areas and regional areas of Australia. Southern Cross also produces over 800 podcasts, 50 music stations and live sports coverage, but does not publish any newspapers or own any TV licences or assets. The ACCC’s review considered how closely Seven and Southern Cross compete across different markets, including in the supply of advertising opportunities, the supply of media content to consumers and the acquisition of media content from producers in Australia. In its investigation, the ACCC focussed on various local markets in regional Western Australia where Southern Cross and Seven are the main traditional media outlets offering advertising opportunities for local businesses. “We found that Southern Cross and Seven attract different advertisers and are not close competitors for the supply of advertising opportunities in these regions,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. “Local businesses and media agencies seeking to advertise in regional areas will continue to have a range of options in these local markets, including online and social media advertising with geo-targeting capabilities.” The ACCC also considered whether the proposed merger could lessen competition in markets for the supply of media content to consumers or for the acquisition of media content from producers. “The ACCC’s investigation found that Southern Cross and Seven are not close competitors for content. Southern Cross is primarily focused on radio and audio entertainment, while Seven is focused on print news and general TV,” Mr Keogh said. Also important in the ACCC’s decision was the impact of broader industry trends on competition, including the rise of streaming services and the significant growth of online advertising. “Australian media markets are being transformed by consumers’ growing preference for digital media,” Mr Keogh said. “This shift is leading advertisers to invest more heavily in online and digital channels.” “Owners of traditional media platforms such as radio, free-to-air television and newspapers will continue to face strong competition from digital media.

Notes to editors In considering the proposed acquisition, the ACCC applies the legal test set out in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. In general terms, section 50 prohibits acquisitions that would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in any market. The “substantial lessening of competition” test focuses on the extent to which the merger parties constrain each other, and the effect of removing this competitive constraint on prices, quality or choice. It is not the same as a diversity (range of views) or plurality (number of voices) test and is not a public interest test. This acquisition is also subject to approval from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 which regulates the number of independent media ‘voices’ in a market. The ACMA’s ‘voices’ assessment considers the number of suppliers of commercial television and radio broadcasting services, and certain types of newspapers within particular geographic regions. The ACCC’s competition assessment is not restricted to particular media types and therefore can consider a broad range of outlets and advertising options, including streaming and online search. Questions about the ACMA’s voices requirements are best directed to the ACMA. The ACCC’s decision not to oppose this transaction under the Competition and Consumer Act is not an indication on how the ACMA will assess this transaction under the Broadcasting Services Act.

    "full_text": "Date 12 November 2025 Topics Competition and exemptions Soft Plastic Stewardship Australia (SPSA) and its industry members have been granted an eight-year authorisation by the ACCC allowing them to collect and recycle used soft plastic packaging under a voluntary scheme. The soft plastic collection and recycling scheme has been developed by food and grocery industry stakeholders, including Woolworths, Coles, ALDI, Nestlé, Mars and McCormick Foods, but will be run by SPSA. The scheme aims to increase the collection and recycling of soft plastic packaging from consumers, such as shopping bags and food wrappers. The ACCC was not involved in the design of the scheme and is not involved in its operations. SPSA and its industry members applied to the ACCC to have their collaboration in relation to this scheme be exempt from some of Australia’s competition laws. The ACCC may grant an exemption, called an ‘authorisation’, if it finds there is an overall public benefit. “As the scheme aims to acquire and broaden the current instore and kerbside trial collection programs for soft plastic recycling, we’ve determined that it will likely result in some soft plastics being diverted from landfill,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. “We consider this is an environmental benefit.” Industry participants will pay a fee based on how much soft plastic packaging they generate each year. “It is clear from the ACCC’s consultation process that many Australians want to recycle soft plastic packing and are concerned about its environmental impacts,” Mr Keogh said. “The recycling and collection options currently available to consumers are limited, and we consider that the SPSA scheme is an important way to expand those choices.” Broader issues of policy and regulations around soft plastics, including decisions about whether to introduce mandatory regulations, are beyond the scope of the ACCC’s role as the competition regulator and administrative decision-maker for the current application. “We don’t consider that the SPSA scheme will delay or deter other regulatory approaches to soft plastic stewardship,” Mr Keogh said. The ACCC’s exemption is subject to the following conditions: SPSA must complete annual public reporting about the performance of the scheme to ensure its transparency; The scheme must be independently reviewed in the third and seventh year of its operation and these reviews must consider recommendations for improvements to the scheme’s operations and governance; SPSA’s board must include at least two independent directors; and SPSA cannot enter into exclusive contracts with processors. More information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at Soft Plastic Stewardship Australia Limited . Note to editors The ACCC is not an environmental regulator and does not regulate the creation or use of soft plastic packaging, nor does it create or manage recycling schemes. The Australian Government, including the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water , is working to reform Australia’s packaging regulations to minimise packaging waste and pollution and build a circular economy for packaging. This reform is separate to this scheme. The ACCC’s role as Australia’s competition regulator includes assessing applications for competitors to work together, called ‘authorisations’. Broadly, the ACCC may grant an exemption when it is satisfied that the public benefit from the conduct outweighs any public detriment. Where ACCC authorisation is granted, it provides statutory protection from court action for certain conduct by competitors that might otherwise raise concerns under the Competition and Consumer Act. SPSA sought an exemption as some of the activities planned through the scheme involve competitors working together, which can sometimes risk breaching Australia’s competition laws. The authorisation and exemption role is limited to the exemption from specific sections of the Act, and, in this instance, authorisation is granted only in respect of Division 1 of Part IV and sections 45 and 47 of the Act. Background From 2011 to 2022, a return-to-store soft plastics collection program called ‘REDcycle’ partnered with major supermarkets to provide collection points for consumers to return used soft plastic packaging to stores for collection and recycling. REDcycle was funded by supermarkets and retail brands from several industries, including food and grocery, clothing and electronics, and at the time of its collapse, had approximately 192 participants in its program. After the collapse of the REDcycle program in 2022, the ACCC authorised ALDI, Coles and Woolworths to work together as part of the Soft Plastics Taskforce to pilot instore collections and process the stockpile of soft plastics that was left. The Taskforce was designed as a temporary arrangement to precede the development of a broader industry-wide stewardship program. The Soft Plastics Taskforce is chaired by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. The ACCC granted a further authorisation with conditions in February 2025 with respect to the Soft Plastics Taskforce and processing of the stockpile, which is due to expire on 31 July 2026. On 11 August 2025, the ACCC released a draft determination proposing to grant authorisation, with conditions, for eight years. The ACCC also granted interim authorisation allowing SPSA to: set (but not collect) the levy; arrange for services to operate the scheme (e.g. issue a request for information to processors); and share operational information with Coles, Woolworths, and ALDI, so SPSA can prepare to take over existing collections run by Soft Plastics Taskforce. Under this authorisation, SPSA intends to take over and expand the pilot instore collection program being run by the Soft Plastics Taskforce, as well as providing kerbside collections and potential drop off facilities.

    "full_text": "Speeches APRA Executive Director Carmen Beverley-Smith's remarks to the ASFA Conference 2025 Wednesday 12 November 2025 Print Email Building trust Superannuation in Australia, particularly, is built on a system of trust. Fund members entrust their retirement savings to the safekeeping of superannuation funds. They trust that their monies will be managed well and invested in their best interests. Even those most disengaged with their super, will have some level of confidence that their super is safe, their “nest egg” is growing and will be available to them in retirement. In our superannuation system, which has earned recognition on the world stage for its strength and success, that trust has been readily gained. But it should never be taken for granted. After a year marked by cyberattacks, multiple operational incidents and the high-profile collapse of two managed investment schemes offered through trustee-provided platforms, public trust and confidence in superannuation is certainly being put to the test. It is a recurring theme in the media, at industry events and in my own discussions with the Chairs, trustee board directors, CEOs and executives of funds that APRA regulates. As each new high-profile challenge emerges, the effectiveness with which funds manage the challenge, and support members through that challenge, attracts increasing public scrutiny and shapes community expectations. The events of this year serve as a reminder that trust is not static. Funds must continuously strive to maintain member confidence in their super as the stewards of it. My observation is that the best way to do this is by focusing on achieving three baseline capabilities: strong leadership, operational resilience and member-centricity. Strong Leadership The challenges and complexities of Australia’s $4.3 trillion super industry demand strong, courageous, accountable and transparent leadership. Leadership by all industry participants. Strong collaboration by industry bodies and leaders at the highest level of superannuation funds is essential to support cohesive and timely responses to external threats and strengthen member confidence. Effective leadership within fund themselves is also critical. I am often asked why I dedicate a large proportion of my time interacting with trustee directors and fund executives. While there is no prudential standard that articulates an overt obligation for trustees and fund executives to be “good leaders”, leaders set the tone, the direction, the expectations, the standards, the culture and ultimately determine the performance and success of their organisations. Leadership matters. Strong leadership is critical to having a well-run super fund and I am more than “interested” in that. It is also why APRA is specifically interested in the quality and capability of trustee boards. APRA is currently engaging with the industry to uplift board governance standards, not just in super but also across banking and insurance. The proposals, which were amended following the recent industry consultation, cover board member fitness and propriety, tenure and capabilities and skills, among other things. APRA expects to release draft governance standards and guidance in the second quarter of next year. While the governance review was not triggered by any superannuation-related issues, APRA has experienced concerns about how some boards have assessed fitness and propriety of directors in the not-so-distant past. Through our supervision work, we have also identified concerns regarding the strength of board oversight in areas core to superannuation, including investment governance. A recent APRA thematic review into unlisted asset valuations and liquidity risk governance found that, although asset valuation governance had improved since a previous review in 2021, 12 out of the 23 in-scope trustees required material improvement in either or both their valuation governance policies and practices or the design and operations of their liquidity risk management frameworks. APRA also observed cases of weaknesses in board oversight of asset valuations and conflicts of interest management. Just last month, APRA concluded a review of platform trustees and identified significant weaknesses in the practices of some trustees. The gaps are in areas such as due diligence and onboarding practices, ongoing monitoring of investment options, and remedial action where member outcomes are not being delivered. The in-scope trustees of that review are collectively responsible for 95 per cent of member assets held on platforms. APRA has required all trustees involved in that review to assess their practices, address weaknesses, and report any breaches of the prudential standards to us as a matter of urgency. In parallel, APRA has performed its own assessment of those trustees’ practices, who should expect to hear from us shortly. Where required, we will take appropriate supervisory or enforcement action to drive improvements and ensure member funds are being managed prudently. We expect this will be an ongoing, significant area of focus into 2026. Operational resilience Given the non-discretionary nature of superannuation contributions, Australians have an expectation that those who manage their superannuation savings are doing so well. Whether stated or implied, they rightly expect that funds have capable people, effective processes, sound data management practices and modern systems commensurate with their funds’ requirements. While some in this room might acknowledge that superannuation can be complex, many Australians believe it is “simple”.  And they expect the simple, done well: that is, their fund collects, grows and protects their retirement savings and then when they need it, that core services, such as rollovers and pension payments, are delivered without a hitch. Which brings me to the second baseline capability – operational resilience. As funds grow and the industry evolves and matures to become increasingly reliant on digital technology and third-party providers to deliver the services and experience members expect, the threat environment is heightened and the need for robust practices, processes and risk management increases significantly. The launch of APRA’s operational risk management standard CPS 230 in July, and the implementation of the Financial Accountability Regime for super, which also took effect this year, have clarified and emphasised the obligations and accountability of funds and their leaders for managing operational risks. APRA expects funds to understand intimately their key processes that deliver on commitments to members and to manage the risks and vulnerabilities in those processes and the data and systems that enable them – regardless of who physically performs those processes, be it in-house teams or contracted third parties. It may not always be possible to prevent things from going wrong, but we expect funds to be ready to respond quickly if they do, to minimise the impact on their members. APRA will continue to engage with entities to assess their adherence with the standard. The evolving and elevated cyber risk environment in which the superannuation industry operates is another area that requires ongoing and diligent oversight by senior leaders and a co-ordinated industry approach. Cyber resilience is a high priority focus for APRA, our peer regulators and government. Although the credential stuffing incidents which occurred earlier this year were relatively minor and contained, the occurrence exposed persistent weaknesses in access controls, specifically authentication across the industry. These incidents followed multiple warnings from APRA, including our clear message that multi-factor authentication is the bare minimum expectation in relation to cyber controls. After those attacks, APRA required all trustees to review their information security controls, including their authentication controls, and to submit breach notifications to APRA if any material control weaknesses were identified. We are in the final stages of assessing the responses from industry, including the more detailed actions required by the entities directly affected by the incidents. I would like to think I don’t need to say this, but APRA expect trustees to demonstrate that they meet their obligations under APRA’s Information Security standard CPS 234 on an ongoing basis. I also acknowledge that, given the pace at which the threat environment is evolving and maturing, what was required to meet those obligations a month ago might not be sufficient today. It is important to remember that CPS 234 articulates compliance obligations or minimum requirements. It by no means represents the level of information security governance that well managed funds should aspire to. Commitment to act in best financial interests of members The third baseline capability for building trust is acting consistently in the best financial interests of members. This is not an expectation as such; it is a legal obligation. One area where we’ve been concerned that some funds might not be meeting their best financial interests duty is in relation to expenditure decisions. A year ago, we intensified our scrutiny of how funds were spending members’ monies. That work has been supported by fund-level expenditure data that APRA now collects and publishes on an annual basis. We wanted to challenge spending by funds where the benefit to members was not immediately apparent or could not be reasonably justified. We have since sought information from 14 trustees, of varying scale and differing business models, and reviewed thousands of documents relating to discretionary expenditure including in relation to sponsorships, marketing, conferences, entertainment and related entity spending. Earlier this year we provided industry with an update on our fund expenditure work, including key observations and examples of better practice and areas for improvement, which we expect trustees have reviewed and compared against their own practices. We’ve also made it clear that where practices fall short of legal requirements, APRA will utilise the full range of its powers to hold a trustee accountable. Another way that super entities can demonstrate they are acting in the best interests of members is through their commitment to embrace their obligations under the Retirement Income Covenant. The covenant was introduced three years ago to ensure the industry had strategies to support the growing numbers of Australians transitioning to retirement, as well as those already in the retirement phase. It has put a much-needed emphasis on the retirement phase of superannuation, building upon the industry’s long-standing focus on and success in the accumulation phase. Despite the continued increase in members and sharp growth of assets in the retirement phase, the industry’s progress in implementing the covenant has been somewhat inconsistent. A thematic review conducted by APRA and ASIC one year after the covenant came into effect showed a lack of urgency the industry to meet their obligations. While we have seen progress and improvements since then, there is a clear and growing gap between trustees who are meeting baseline expectations and those who have embraced retirement as a strategic and competitive imperative. We will be able to share more insights into trustees’ progress in meeting their covenant obligations with the release of the results of the latest APRA and ASIC pulse check survey in two weeks’ time. But it is clear that, in many cases, trustees can and should be doing more to support their members in retirement. With another 2.5 million fund members expected to transition from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase this decade, trustees who are doing the bare minimum now may struggle to retain members when better retirement support and solutions are being offered elsewhere. Conclusion One definition of the word “trust” given by the Concise Oxford Dictionary is “confident expectation”. I think that neatly sums up the attitude that we would all want fund members to hold in relation to their superannuation. To have the confident expectation that their retirement savings will be collected, invested and protected during the accumulation phase, to provide a reliable, long-term source of retirement income in their later years. The events of this year have been a wake-up call that that while the expectation component of that definition is clear and a given, member confidence is not. As stewards of many Australians’ retirement savings for over three decades, trustees and fund executives must continue to earn the trust of their members each and every day. It is the obligation of everyone in this room and some not here today to play your part to ensure ongoing confidence in this extraordinary industry. Whatever your role: demonstrate strong and courageous leadership. Lead safe, strong and secure superannuation businesses with consistency for your members. And make that commitment to act, make every decision, in the best financial interests of the nearly 23 million superannuation fund members, whose financial futures you all collectively steward. While you are the custodians of trillions of dollars of retirement savings for the majority of people in this country, their trust is arguably the most important asset you will ever manage. Thank you. 2025 The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry. It oversees banks, mutuals, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, private health insurers, friendly societies, and most members of the superannuation industry. APRA currently supervises institutions holding around $9.8 trillion in assets for Australian depositors, policyholders and superannuation fund members.",
    "ai_summary": "Carmen Beverley-Smith, APRA Executive Director, addressed the ASFA Conference 2025, emphasizing the critical importance of trust in the superannuation system and the need for funds to continuously earn and maintain member confidence. She highlighted recent challenges, including cyberattacks and collapses of managed investment schemes, that have tested public trust and outlined three baseline capabilities essential for building and maintaining trust: strong leadership, operational resilience, and member-centricity.\nHere are the key takeaways for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Elevated Governance Standards:** APRA is focused on uplifting board governance standards across the financial sector, including superannuation. Expect increased scrutiny on board member fitness and propriety, tenure, capabilities, skills, and oversight of critical areas like investment governance, asset valuations, and conflict-of-interest management. Draft governance standards and guidance are expected in the second quarter of next year.\n*   **Strengthened Operational Resilience:** Funds must understand and manage risks to key processes, data, and systems, whether managed internally or by third parties. APRA expects quick responses to incidents to minimize member impact. Cyber resilience remains a high priority, with ongoing reviews of information security controls, including authentication measures, against CPS 234.\n*   **Best Financial Interests Focus:** APRA is scrutinizing fund expenditure to ensure it demonstrably benefits members. They have been challenging spending where the benefit to members was not immediately apparent or could not be reasonably justified. Funds should expect continued scrutiny and potential enforcement action where practices fall short of legal requirements.\n*   **Retirement Income Covenant Implementation:** While some progress has been made, APRA sees inconsistent implementation of the Retirement Income Covenant across the industry. Trustees should proactively support members transitioning to retirement with better retirement support and solutions. Results of the latest APRA and ASIC pulse check survey will provide more insights.\n*   **Trust as a Core Asset:** Beverley-Smith emphasized that member trust is the most important asset that fund executives will ever manage. She urged attendees to demonstrate strong leadership, lead safe and secure superannuation businesses, and make every decision in the best financial interests of members.",

Furthermore, the emphasis on CPS 230, the Financial Accountability Regime, and CPS 234, coupled with APRA's intent to take \"appropriate supervisory or enforcement action,\" points to potentially high compliance risk and the need for major operational changes.

    "full_text": "Date 12 November 2025 Topics Compliance and enforcement Construction company John Holland and the Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union (CFMEU) have voluntarily terminated their agreements requiring John Holland to use only three specific labour hire businesses on two major infrastructure projects, following an ACCC investigation. The ACCC was concerned the agreements between John Holland and the New South Wales Branch of the CFMEU prevented other labour hire businesses from competing for work on the projects. The agreements were about the use of labour hire on the M1 Pacific Motorway Extension to Raymond Terrace (the M1 Project) and M7–M12 integration project in New South Wales. In response to the ACCC’s concerns, John Holland has agreed not to make any agreements with unions in future that would limit its choice of labour hire companies or create certain preferential arrangements. John Holland has also committed to implementing a competition law compliance assessment when reviewing agreements with unions, and undertaking staff training on the application of competition law in industrial relations. “Genuine competition relies on businesses making independent decisions, and suppliers competing vigorously to get work,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. “We are pleased that John Holland and the CFMEU have addressed our competition concerns by voluntarily terminating the agreements in question following our investigation.” John Holland and the CFMEU cooperated with the ACCC during its investigation. The agreements between John Holland and the CFMEU were made in December 2023. The ACCC began its investigation following media reports last year.

In addition to quarterly petrol monitoring reports, the ACCC also prepares petrol industry reports on particular aspects of consumer interest in the fuel market in relation to prices, costs and profits. As part of its monitoring activities, the ACCC currently collects volume and other data from the following companies: Ampol, bp, ExxonMobil, Viva Energy, Chevron, United Petroleum, 7-Eleven and EG Group, as well as data for the Coles Express/Reddy Express and On The Run retail networks (provided by Viva Energy).

It finds a correlation between a greater presence of these retailers and lower petrol prices in certain cities. The report also details the evolving market composition of the petroleum industry, including the increasing market share of smaller independent retailers and the concentration of supply and wholesale activities.\nHere are the key takeaways for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Competition and Pricing:** Cities with more independent petrol retailers tend to have lower average petrol prices, suggesting increased competition benefits consumers.\n*   **Market Share Growth:** Smaller independent petrol retailers are increasing their market share, now accounting for around 26% of national retail petrol sales in 2023-24 (up from 18% in 2017-18).\n*   **Supply and Wholesale Concentration:** A small number of major companies (Ampol, bp, ExxonMobil, and Viva Energy) continue to dominate petrol supply and wholesale activities in Australia, accounting for approximately 88% of supply and 85% of wholesale sales in 2023-24.\n*   **ACCC Monitoring:** The ACCC continues to monitor the petrol industry and publishes quarterly reports on prices, costs, and profits, along with specific reports on areas of consumer interest.",

Between 1 February 2012 and 20 November 2023, Mr Prior was the director of Cosmopolitan Double Bay Pty Ltd, Jaws Enterprises Pty Ltd and Angelo’s Restaurant Pty Ltd. At the time of ASIC’s decision, the three companies owed a combined total of $5,764,098 to unsecured creditors, including statutory debts to the AustralianTaxation Office, Workers Compensation Nominal Insurers as well as other trade creditors. ASIC found that Mr Prior acted improperly and failed to meet his obligations when he: failed to exercise due care and diligence to ensure that the companies met their statutory lodgement requirements, improperly used his position to cause detriment to the companies, and to gain an advantage for other companies, failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the companies maintained adequate financial records, and failed to ensure that the companies did not trade while insolvent. In disqualifying Mr Prior, ASIC relied on supplementary reports lodged by the liquidator of Cosmopolitan Double Bay Pty Ltd, Shumit Banerjee of the firm Westburn Advisory, and the liquidator of Jaws Enterprises Pty Ltd, Gess Rambaldi of the firm Pitcher Partners. ASIC assisted Mr Banerjee to prepare his report by providing funding from the Assetless Administration Fund.

ASIC alleges AVZ breached continuous disclosure obligations and engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by failing to announce an escalating legal dispute in the DRC relating to the acquisition of shares in AVZ’s flagship Manono Project to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). ASIC also alleges AVZ’s Managing Director Nigel Ferguson and Technical Director Graeme Johnston breached their director’s duties, authorised or permitted ASX announcements relating to AVZ that were false or misleading, or omitted matters that rendered them misleading. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘proper disclosures were critically important to investors, particularly when the company is operating an asset overseas. ‘In this case it was all but impossible for retail investors to travel to an overseas location in central Africa, in which the company’s operations are being conducted. In those circumstances, investors rely on the company to provide accurate and timely information. We allege Mr Ferguson and Mr Johnston failed to inform investors of the ongoing issues in this matter for nearly 12 months. ‘The pair allegedly failed to take reasonable steps to ensure AVZ complied with its continuous disclosure obligations and that statements to the ASX were not misleading or deceptive. ‘Continuous disclosure and director duties are not only legal obligations they are fundamental principles that protect the integrity of financial markets. ‘ASIC is committed to taking action against any entities we consider fail to meet these obligations, to ensure accountability and to maintain investor confidence,’ Ms Court said. On 4 May 2022, AVZ confirmed to the market that it retained legal title to a 75% interest in the Manono Project however went on to refer to ‘recent media speculation in respect of several matters in connection with AVZ's interest in the Manono Project, which the Company considers spurious and immaterial’.

On 7 November 2025, the District Court of NSW sentenced Mr Agrawal to prison terms of: three years and three months for using false documents to obtain a financial advantage, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and three years and ten months for dishonestly using his position as a director with the intention to gain advantage and cause detriment, contrary to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

Mr Agrawal is the current and former director of 27 companies collectively known as the Mansa Group, which is now in liquidation.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC’s current review of Australia’s motor vehicle finance sector has exposed cracks in some lenders’ oversight of car finance distributors—revealing problematic sales tactics, and a lack of regular audits and checks by lenders. ASIC’s review follows a spike in complaints about motor vehicle finance to the regulator, as well as reports from consumer advocates about excessive establishment and interest costs as part of various car finance arrangements. Most lenders examined by ASIC rely on intermediaries, such as brokers and dealerships, to arrange motor vehicle finance, with ASIC uncovering significant variations in loan establishment costs. ‘We saw instances of loan establishment fees as high as $9,000 on a loan of $49,000,’ ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said. ‘We also found that almost half of all consumers who defaulted on their car finance repayments did so within the first six months of the loan. And of vehicles that were repossessed and sold, nearly 90% of consumers still owed more than half of their original loan amount. ‘These numbers raise questions about whether these consumers have been given loans they cannot afford to repay, which is consistent with key themes in complaints that led to this review.’ ASIC will continue its probe to understand why such considerable cost differences exist and separately why many customers cannot keep up with repayments in the first year of their loan term. The initial phase of this review examined every stage of a customer’s journey, from finance application, loan assessment and responsible lending checks to hardship requests, support, and dispute resolution. It highlighted the impact of unaffordable loans on customers and how this is resulting in poor consumer outcomes. In response, ASIC has issued tailored action letters to participating lenders based on our preliminary findings, with specific recommendations for each. The range of identified areas for improvement include: Better training, accreditation processes and oversight of lenders’ finance distribution channels Stronger product review triggers and risk frameworks using consumer harm indicators and available data, including internal and external dispute resolution data to ensure products reach the right target market Improved communication when financial hardship arrangements are in place (in line with ASIC’s recent hardship report ), including better information on voluntary surrender options Enhanced governance frameworks to ensure adequate oversight of intermediary brokers and dealers. Detailed findings from ASIC’s review will be released in 2026 and will include information on how lenders have responded to ASIC’s recommendations. Mr Kirkland said, ‘We’ve identified areas where lenders must lift their standards, or risk leaving consumers exposed to poor financial outcomes. ‘ASIC will take enforcement action to protect consumers where appropriate.’ ASIC currently has proceedings against car dealership Diamond Wheels, Keo Automotive and a former director for allegedly providing car loans to consumers while unlicensed, with many of those consumers having paid an excessive interest rate ( 24-209MR ). ASIC also took action against Money3 Loans following numerous complaints, including from consumer advocates, about the inappropriate provision of finance to vulnerable consumers. While the court recently ruled largely in Money3’s favour, some limited contraventions of the responsible lending provisions of the Credit Act were found ( 25-198MR ). Background This review takes a broad look at the motor vehicle finance sector, noting that misconduct in used car finance sold to vulnerable consumers remains a key enforcement priority for ASIC in 2025. The project aims to drive real change across industry, reducing consumer harm and improving outcomes for all car finance customers, including those in regional and remote areas and First Nations communities.

    "full_text": "Date 11 November 2025 Topics Buying and selling products and services Problem with a product or service Stay protected Children’s entertainment group The Wiggles Holdings Pty Ltd (The Wiggles) has admitted it likely breached the Australian Consumer Law by selling Emma Bow headbands without mandatory safety warnings required for products containing button batteries, and has committed to raising awareness of the dangers that button batteries can pose. The Wiggles’ Emma Bow is a yellow and black headband featuring four lights powered by button batteries. Between June 2022 and March 2024, The Wiggles sold the headband without mandatory safety warnings that it contained button batteries and about the risks that button batteries pose. The Wiggles has provided the ACCC with a court-enforceable undertaking in which it admits it likely breached the Australian Consumer Law by supplying headbands which failed to comply with the Button Battery Information Standard and commits to implementing a consumer law compliance program within their organisation. The importer and distributor of the headband, CA Australia Pty Ltd (CA Australia), has also provided a written commitment to the ACCC to improve its consumer law compliance. “The Emma Bow was aimed for children’s use and was available at The Wiggles’ live concerts.  It was also sold by other suppliers on The Wiggles online store and through various physical retail stores” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “Without a warning on the product, parents may not have known it contained button batteries and not understood the severity of the risk.” “If swallowed, a button battery can become stuck in a child’s throat and result in catastrophic injuries, and even death, in as little as two hours,” Ms Lowe said. As part of its co-operation with the ACCC’s investigation, The Wiggles has committed to produce an episode of its podcast “Wiggle Talk – A Podcast For Parents”, which will refer to the recall of the Emma Bow headband, and discuss safety issues relating to button batteries and children’s toys to help raise awareness. The Wiggles and CA Australia recalled the product and a recall notice was published on the ACCC website on 1 August 2024. Consumers who still have the Emma Bow should refer to the recall notice for further information, including to arrange for a return of the product. Compliance with button battery standards is a priority for the ACCC. Button batteries pose a significant risk to vulnerable young children and the button battery mandatory standards are an important step in helping to prevent injuries to children. The undertaking can be found here: The Wiggles Holdings Pty Ltd Images of the Emma Bow product ACCC guidance for businesses and consumers The mandatory button battery standards aim to make button battery products safer and provide consumers with important safety information to mitigate the risks associated with button batteries. The Information Standard requires certain warnings and safety information to be provided with button battery products and/or packaging. Button batteries are small, round and shiny and can be appealing for young children to swallow or insert, which poses a significant risk of serious injury or death. In Australia, three children have died from incidents involving button batteries. Compliance with the mandatory standards helps to prevent this. If you suspect your child has swallowed or inserted a button battery: call Triple Zero (000) immediately if your child is bleeding or having any difficulty breathing call 13 11 26 immediately for 24/7 fast and expert advice from the Poisons Information Centre. Prompt action is critical, do not wait for symptoms to develop. Serious injury can occur in as little as two hours and can be fatal. The ACCC strongly encourages consumers to check for button battery products in their homes and take steps to secure them to keep them safe for young children. Consumers can check the list of recalled products on the ACCC Product Safety website. Anyone who has experienced product safety incidents (including near misses) is strongly encouraged to report these to the supplier and to report safety concerns about particular products to the ACCC via the Product Safety website . Suppliers of button battery products must submit a report to the ACCC within 2 days if they become aware that a consumer good they have supplied caused or may have caused a death, serious injury or serious illness. Further information about this reporting can be found in the ACCC’s Mandatory Reporting Guideline . The ACCC has published a fact sheet and guide for businesses on the button battery mandatory standards to assist businesses with meeting their obligations. Background The Wiggles is a children’s musical entertainment group. It also licences its intellectual property and rights to supply products to third parties. CA Australia is a designer, manufacturer and wholesaler of soft plush toys. It was the only importer of the Emma Bow headband into Australia and the exclusive supplier of it to The Wiggles. There are four mandatory safety and information standards for button and coin batteries, and products containing them. They apply to all levels of the supply chain, including manufacturers, importers and retailers. It is alleged that during the period from 22 June 2022 to 24 March 2024, The Wiggles supplied 3,164 of the headbands to consumers. It is alleged that during the period from 23 June 2022 to 19 September 2023 CA Australia supplied at least 3,764 headbands, including to The Wiggles and other third-party retailers. The Wiggles has recalled the Emma Bow product for the entire period it was supplied, 1 November 2015 to 24 March 2024. The Button Battery Information Standard came in force on 22 June 2022.

The podcast will be published within the next 6 months across YouTube, Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Other button battery enforcement outcomes include: In May 2025, Hungry Jack’s paid penalties totalling $150,240 after the ACCC issued 8 infringement notices for supplying a Garfield-themed Toy that allegedly did not comply with Australia’s mandatory button battery standards. Hungry Jack’s also provided the ACCC with a court-enforceable undertaking. In April 2025, the ACCC commenced proceedings against Fewstone Pty Ltd (trading as City Beach) regarding allegations that City Beach offered for sale 70 product lines containing button batteries which did not comply with the button battery standards.

    "full_text": "Date 6 November 2025 Topics Compliance and enforcement Problem with a product or service Stay protected Most furniture suppliers are failing to comply with new mandatory information rules that warn customers of the dangers of furniture tipping over, a sweep of businesses has revealed. The ACCC and state and territory consumer protection agencies examined over 3000 furniture products at more than 160 businesses. Of those businesses, 90 per cent were non-compliant with the mandatory toppling furniture information standard in relation to one or more of their products and more than half were non-compliant in relation to all products examined. Toppling furniture has killed at least 28 people in Australia since 2000 and causes nearly 20 injuries every week. The mandatory information standard, which came into effect on 4 May 2025, aims to reduce accidents and deaths due to furniture tipping over. It requires toppling furniture safety warnings to be provided to consumers online and in-store at point of sale, on products purchased by consumers, and in instructions that accompany products. “Unsecured furniture items like bookcases and cabinets can unexpectedly tip over causing severe injury or death,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “It can happen when a child climbs or pulls on open drawers or when an elderly person uses furniture for support. Young children and older Australians are at greatest risk of injury.” “We undertook surveillance, in partnership with state and territory consumer protection agencies, which included visiting stores around the country and online, to raise awareness of the importance of compliance with the new mandatory information standard,” Ms Lowe said. “We are concerned about the low levels of compliance. It is critical that businesses include warnings and safety information on toppling furniture.” The sweep found 90 per cent of furniture suppliers had one or more products which failed to include mandatory warnings. About 52 per cent were fully non-compliant, meaning all toppling furniture products inspected had either no warning information displayed or had incorrect or incomplete information. Only 10 per cent of businesses were assessed as fully compliant with the mandatory information standard requirements. “The ACCC expects suppliers to take all reasonable steps to comply with the standard, to reduce the risk of death and injury associated with toppling furniture,” Ms Lowe said. “We will be continuing to monitor businesses to ensure they are displaying the mandatory safety warnings so that consumers have the information they need to stay safe. “We expect to see significant improvement in compliance and will consider enforcement action if this does not occur,” Ms Lowe said. The ACCC and state and territory consumer protection agencies have informed furniture suppliers who were assessed as non-compliant and requested rectification. Suppliers who fail to comply with the standard may face enforcement action including fines and penalties . Suppliers had a 12-month transition period from May 2024 to May 2025 to comply with the new information and labelling requirements. Information for suppliers Supplying a product that fails to comply with the information standard is a contravention of the Australian Consumer Law and may expose a business or individual to potential enforcement action by the ACCC. The maximum financial penalties for businesses are the greatest of: $50,000,000; three times the value of the \"reasonably attributable\" benefit obtained from the conduct, if the court can determine this; or if a court cannot determine the benefit, 30 per cent of adjusted turnover during the breach period. The maximum financial penalty for individuals is $2,500,000. The ACCC published supplier guidance to assist suppliers to comply with the mandatory standard. The information standard requires suppliers to: attach permanent safety warning labels to furniture, display safety warnings at the point of sale in-store and online, and provide safety information and warnings in instruction manuals. All suppliers in the supply chain, including retailers, wholesalers and distributers, are required to comply with the mandatory information standard. ACCC consumer guidance The ACCC published consumer guidance to inform consumers about the risks associated with toppling furniture, including how to pick safer furniture when shopping and how to properly anchor furniture to prevent tip over. Consumers are encouraged to report concerns about unsafe or non-compliant furniture items to the supplier and the ACCC using the Product Safety Australia website .

The sweep, conducted by the ACCC and state/territory consumer protection agencies, revealed widespread non-compliance among furniture suppliers.\nHere are the key takeaways:\n*   **Widespread Non-Compliance:** A significant 90% of furniture suppliers examined were found to be non-compliant with the mandatory information standard regarding toppling furniture safety warnings. Over half were non-compliant across all products examined.\n*   **Mandatory Standard Requirements:** The mandatory information standard, effective since May 4, 2025, requires specific safety warnings to be displayed online, in-store at the point of sale, on the product itself, and within the product's instruction manuals.\n*   **Enforcement Action Possible:** The ACCC expects suppliers to comply with the standard and will consider enforcement action, including fines and penalties, for non-compliance. Significant penalties apply for breaches of the Australian Consumer Law.\n*   **Supplier Guidance Available:** The ACCC has published supplier guidance to assist businesses in understanding and complying with the mandatory information standard.

    "full_text": "Media Release Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision Number 2025-31 Date 4 November 2025 At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent. Inflation has recently picked up. Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. More recently, however, inflation has picked up. Trimmed mean inflation was 1.0 per cent in the September quarter and 3.0 per cent over the year, up from 2.7 per cent over the year in the June quarter. This was materially higher than expected at the time of the August Statement on Monetary Policy . Headline inflation rose sharply to 3.2 per cent over the year in the September quarter, a large part of which was expected given the cessation of electricity rebates in a number of states. The Board’s judgement is that some of the increase in underlying inflation in the September quarter was due to temporary factors. The central forecast in the November Statement on Monetary Policy , which is based on a technical assumption of one more rate cut in 2026, has underlying inflation rising above 3 per cent in coming quarters before settling at 2.6 per cent in 2027. Domestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain. Data on consumption suggest that the pick-up in private demand evident in the June quarter is ongoing. The housing market is continuing to strengthen, a sign that recent interest rate reductions are having an effect. Housing prices are rising and dwelling construction costs have also started to increase again after a period of weak growth. Credit is readily available to both households and businesses. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, notwithstanding a recent easing. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected and the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 per cent in September from 4.3 per cent in August. But measures of labour underutilisation remain at low rates, job vacancies are still at a high level and business surveys and liaison continue to suggest that a significant share of firms are experiencing difficulty sourcing labour. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but productivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both domestic and international developments. On the domestic side, if the pick-up in private demand continues to exceed expectations, this could increase the demand for labour, add to capacity pressures and make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases. Alternatively, the improvement in private demand might not persist. Uncertainty in the global economy remains elevated but so far there has been minimal impact on overall growth and trade, and many forecasters have revised up their near-term expectations for world growth. Trade policy developments are still expected to have an adverse effect on world growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat to the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions in the domestic economy. There are also uncertainties regarding the assessment that monetary policy remains a little restrictive, the lags in the effect of recent monetary easing, the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and the outlook for productivity growth. These uncertainties present risks in both directions to the inflation and employment outlook. Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority. The recent data on inflation suggest that some inflationary pressure may remain in the economy. With private demand recovering and labour market conditions still appearing a little tight, the Board decided that it was appropriate to maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the beginning of the year, but it will take some time to see the full effects of earlier cash rate reductions. Given this, and the recent evidence of more persistent inflation, the Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of uncertainty about the outlook in both directions. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Decision Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

This follows industry feedback highlighting challenges when applying the new standard ’s contractual obligations to arrangements with non-traditional service providers (NTSPs). NTSPs are providers that are typically market-mandated, such as stock exchanges, payment schemes or clearing and settlement facilities. Arrangements with these providers often lack formal contracts or rely on standardised, non-negotiable terms. APRA recognises initial difficulties faced by regulated entities in implementing the new standard and appreciates the industry’s effort to identify pragmatic solutions. The proposed amendments will clarify APRA’s expectations for arrangements with NTSPs, particularly around contract uplift and service level monitoring. The changes aim to streamline processes for regulated entities and alleviate regulatory burden, while ensuring a practical prudential framework that enhances resilience across the financial system. All other risk obligations under CPS 230 will remain unchanged. APRA will run an accelerated policy process, including a one-month consultation period, to finalise the targeted changes before 1 July 2026, ensuring a smooth transition and regulatory balance.

    "full_text": "Speeches APRA Member Suzanne Smith - Speech to Financial Services and ASX Sector Assurance Forum 2025 Tuesday 28 October 2025 Print Email A time-tested approach for a new world of technological risks Key points “Technology has become ever more integrated into the business models of APRA-regulated entities, whether it be “tap and go” payments, super members accessing their balances on their phones or insurers using drones to assess property damage in the aftermath of a bushfire or flood. Today’s banks, insurers and super funds aren’t simply financial services providers; they have effectively become technology companies, responsible for developing, integrating and maintaining vast systems of enormous capability and complexity and storing reams of sensitive data.” “Many of the banks, insurers and superannuation trustees APRA supervises rely heavily on legacy systems, which are often built on now outdated software and hardware. These systems are typically less resilient to cyber threats as they often fall short of modern requirements for encryption, segregation, user access, authentication, and real-time monitoring.” “One of the key responsibilities internal audit has is making sure the fundamentals are in place, particularly with respect to workforce planning, employee engagement and the delivery of digital transformation initiatives. Internal audit should also be alert to cost-cutting and cost optimisation strategies designed to maintain profitability that inadvertently become very expensive. Delaying the replacement of technology assets, for example, often comes with hidden costs which eventually need to be paid.” “One concern APRA is playing close attention to is concentration risk. Across banking, insurance and superannuation, critical operation delivery often hinges on a concentrated set of technology vendors in areas such as the cloud, processors, network, software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). That means if one of these technology providers fails, even temporarily, they can potentially take down services at every company relying on their services.” “Risks may evolve as technology changes, but the broad principles of good risk management remain the same. As auditors and other compliance professionals, your job is to identify the areas of highest risk within your organisations, conduct reviews to ensure these risks are being mitigated, and speak up when they are not.” Good morning. I’m very pleased to be here at this event for the first time. Australia’s financial services industry, as we recognise it today, was arguably born on the 8th of April 1817 in a house rented from an ex-convict in Macquarie Place – just 500 metres from where we are now. The newly created Bank of New South Wales printed notes with the same press used to publish the colony’s daily newspaper. A bank note issued on that first day of business, now owned by the Australian Museum, is hand numbered and personally signed by both the cashier and the president of the bank. It’s made out for a sum of “10 shillings sterling.” 1 Our first bank had no electricity or telephones. The only webs were in the rafters and the only thing stored in clouds was rain – itself a valuable commodity in a colony still dependent on the heavily polluted Tank Stream for fresh water. Yet it made a valuable contribution to economic development in a settlement where rum, barter and “IOUs” had been the predominant currencies for much of its brief history to that point. In contrast, today’s financial services companies possess a level of technological sophistication that was barely imaginable a few decades ago, let alone in the early 19th century. A news article in the Financial Review from 1996, for example, describes Australians taking to telephone banking “like a duck to water” but warns there are doubts they will do the same with internet banking! 2 In the years since, technology has become ever more integrated into the business models of APRA-regulated entities, whether it be “tap and go” payments, super members accessing their balances on their phones or insurers using drones to assess property damage in the aftermath of a bushfire or flood. Today’s banks, insurers and super funds aren’t simply financial services providers; they have effectively become technology companies, responsible for developing, integrating and maintaining vast systems of enormous capability and complexity and storing reams of sensitive data. The innovations now available to these institutions and their customers have delivered amazing benefits in terms of efficiency and convenience. But they have also brought significant risks that need to be managed in areas such as cyber risk, operational risk and data risk. Amplifying the challenges is the speed of modern technological change as each innovation makes others possible in turn. The dawn of the artificial intelligence age promises to turbo-charge that process further, amid predictions our economy – perhaps even society – may be drastically altered in coming years by super-intelligent AI. While technology may assist internal auditors and other risk professionals to do their jobs, the basic principles of good risk management haven’t changed. As a company’s third line of risk management defences, it’s vital that internal auditors continue to probe, ask questions and speak up with an “outside-in” perspective. Just as importantly, boards and senior managers need to heed that voice and take action when material gaps in controls are identified. Cybersecurity When I mention technology-related risks associated, I suspect many of you immediately think of cyber security. In APRA’s most recent stakeholder survey, it was nominated as the number one concern with 91 per cent of banks, insurers and super funds describing it as a critical or high risk. The ongoing rise in digital banking, online superannuation management and digital insurance platforms has led to an expanded attack surface for those with malign intent. Our financial institutions are relentlessly targeted by sophisticated cybercriminals, employing tactics including ransomware, AI-enhanced malicious activities, phishing and supply chain attacks. While the vast majority of these attacks are repelled, it only takes one successful breach to threaten customer data and money and the financial and operational resilience of entire institutions and market stability. Six years after APRA’s first prudential standard on information security, CPS 234, took effect, all APRA-regulated entities take cyber security with the seriousness you’d expect. However, looking across the financial system, the level of cyber resilience remains uneven and persistent gaps remain. A program of tripartite assessments of compliance with CPS 234, which wrapped up last year, revealed sector wide deficiencies. These included incomplete identification and classification of information assets, inadequate authentication controls, sporadic third-party security assurance, irregular and inconsistent testing, and incident response plans not regularly tested with exercises. Since completing the exercise, we’ve been working with entities to close these gaps. While progress is being made, much more uplift is required, as evidenced by the credential stuffing attacks on superannuation funds mid-year. The cyber resilience journey is never done and must continue to evolve to match the increasing sophistication of the threats. We’ve made clear that cyber needs to be treated by the board as a whole-of-business risk, and not just at IT issue, and internal audit has a vital role here. Pointed lines of inquiry include: Has authentication strength matched the increasing threats? Are basic cyber hygiene protocols being followed? Has adequate third-party assurance been undertaken? Is testing sufficient in terms of frequency, coverage and technique? Has incident detection been exercised and has response maturity been tested; and Are detailed CPS 234 incident notifications being lodged promptly? This last point is one I want to stress. APRA-regulated entities are required to notify us in a timely manner, even if the organisation does not have perfect information about the incident. These notices are an important means of ensuring APRA has a clear view of cyber issues at both an entity and system-level. Some incident patterns we’ve observed through these notifications are: accidental data disclosure, such as sensitive customer reports being distributed to the wrong recipient. This highlights weak data handling procedures, inadequate data leakage limits and lack of compensating controls while at the same time as putting vulnerable persons at risk of harm, particularly where domestic violence is involved; credential compromise and a lack of strong authentication. This is enabling credential stuffing and spraying type of attacks to be more effective than they should be, testing entities’ detection and response maturity; insufficient network monitoring and management capabilities. This allows malicious network activity to either remain undetected for an excessive amount of time or limits capabilities to adjust to malicious activity in a manner which allows continued customer service; and service provider incidents. These include exposures in service providers spilling into regulated entities, underscoring third party assurance gaps as well as the effectiveness of techniques to limit contagion. These are not edge cases, they are repeatable patterns that call for broad visible controls, disciplined testing, and timely APRA notifications. A difficult legacy While the explosion in digital financial technologies has opened up new opportunities for cyber adversaries to exploit, old technologies bring their own set of vulnerabilities. Many of the banks, insurers and superannuation trustees APRA supervises rely heavily on legacy systems, which are often built on now outdated software and hardware. These systems are typically less resilient to cyber threats as they often fall short of modern requirements for encryption, segregation, user access, authentication, and real-time monitoring. Entities frequently face difficulties sourcing components or skilled professionals to maintain these systems, which increases the risk of outages that may impede their ability to meet obligations to customers. They also face challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern digital channels, affecting the agility of business models and their long-term competitiveness. With modern financial service consumers demanding fast, seamless transactions available at any hour of the day, including the latest mobile apps, online services and other digital tools, almost every entity I visit is undertaking some sort of technological transformation. These transformation programs are typically expensive, complex, and fraught with logistical, financial, and even ethical challenges. To help avoid these transformations going awry, APRA expects entities to invest appropriately in technology management capability, budgeted technology roadmaps, staff training and communication to minimise risks as they transition legacy systems to more modern platforms. One of the key responsibilities internal audit has is making sure the fundamentals are in place, particularly with respect to workforce planning, employee engagement and the delivery of digital transformation initiatives. Internal audit should also be alert to cost-cutting and cost optimisation strategies designed to maintain profitability that inadvertently become very expensive. Delaying the replacement of technology assets, for example, often comes with hidden costs which eventually need to be paid. One company that paid highly was America’s Southwest Airlines, which suffered a meltdown of its flight scheduling system in December 2022 that left more than two million travellers stranded over 10 days. Unions pointed to years of underinvestment in IT, leaving the airline reliant on “antiquated” technology that became completely overwhelmed at one of the busiest times of the year. In addition to paying out more than $US600 million on refunds and reimbursements, Southwest was fined $US140 million by Federal authorities, plus lost revenue and additional labour costs. 3 Internal audit can and should provide clarity on the potential hidden costs of holding onto legacy systems so they are not overlooked in the hunt for short term savings. As companies undertake their modernisation journeys, operational readiness, including staff capability and robust testing, is central to maintaining service standards and managing customer impacts. APRA has observed that the accelerated adoption of technologies such as software as a service, AI, machine learning or blockchain, can sometimes outpace internal skills and governance frameworks. This can lead to ineffective implementations and increased risk exposure, as well as negative outcomes for customers and employees. Internal audit can play a role here by ensuring thorough risk assessments are conducted for all digital initiatives; and that risks and controls are documented and implemented, incorporated into project planning, tested, and updated when there are changes to the project scope and execution. Clouds and crowds As the costs and complexity of developing and maintaining the modern technological infrastructure needed in financial services grow, companies are becoming more dependent on third-party service providers. This increased use of service providers carries its own risks, which APRA has spoken about extensively in relation to our new prudential standard, CPS 230 Operational Risk Management. In particular, lack of transparency and control over crucial operations can create significant financial and operational threats if not adequately managed. For example, dependency on the cloud and movement of workloads to the cloud environment has exponentially increased third-party and concentration risk, data security and privacy concerns. Consequently, CPS 230 requires entities to have a comprehensive understanding of their supply chain vulnerabilities and develop contingency plans to mitigate potential disruptions. This includes strong contract management, conducting thorough risk assessments, establishing strong partnerships with key suppliers and implementing robust monitoring mechanisms to ensure continuity of operations. One concern APRA is playing close attention to is concentration risk. Across banking, insurance and superannuation, critical operation delivery often hinges on a concentrated set of technology vendors in areas such as the cloud, processors, network, software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). That means if one of these technology providers fails, even temporarily, they can potentially take down services at every company relying on their services. The best-known example of this from recent history was last July’s Crowdstrike outage which disabled 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices worldwide, taking down critical systems at airports, banks, hospitals and supermarkets. 4 To better understand this risk, APRA asked all its regulated entities to submit a list of their material service providers by the beginning of this month. We have now begun analysing the data to develop a financial system-wide view of entities’ reliance on third party service providers and where particular concentration risks may lie. As finance, telecommunications, emerging technologies, and platforms increasingly converge, APRA will continue to engage with Government and regulatory peers as the Critical Infrastructure reforms evolve further. Our focus will remain on shaping sector-wide incident playbooks; improving information sharing; and participating in exercises that test industry coordination with government regulatory agencies including the Council of Financial Regulators. Entities should be undertaking their own work independently to address third-party and concentration risk. This includes undertaking service interdependency mapping and credible scenario testing involving both complete failures and “degraded-mode” operations. These need to be routine and broadly-visible – not “once and done”. Auditors should look for scenario design that includes multi-entity, multi vendor failures, and for clear customer outcome metrics when operating in contingency modes. Your checks need to go beyond checking documents to properly validating whether tolerance levels, mapping, and testing, truly capture real points of failure across first, second, third, and further, parties. Data surge Widespread use of cloud storage across APRA-regulated industries is closely related to another rising technology-related challenge – data risk. This isn’t a new risk, but it’s one that is growing if for no other reason than the volume of data that companies generate each year keeps expanding. The proliferation of customer data across digital channels amplifies privacy, consent, and data management issues. We find many organisations struggle to guide data management, maintain consistent data quality, ensure traceability of data, understand and leverage metadata, and comply with evolving privacy regulations and international regulations. APRA expects our regulated entities to stay on top of this challenge by implementing comprehensive data governance policies, including data mapping, quality controls, robust authorisation and access control, desensitisation of data wherever possible, and regular audits. We also encourage the adoption of privacy-by-design principles and robust data breach response plans. Upping both the stakes and volume of data is rapid expansion in the use of AI, with one forecast estimating demand for AI-ready data centre capacity will rise at an average rate of 33 percent a year between 2023 and 2030. 5 If companies thought they had enough data to manage with seemingly endless internal emails, imagine when most emails are composed with the help of AI! Our preparedness for AI use and deployment must consider new risks and the broadening of current risk, especially in the areas of data. The economics of data aggregation could lead to growing concentration risk, with single-source providers of data and foundational AI models driving greater homogeneity and potentially biased data sets in the financial sector. AI is an emerging area for internal audit to examine and also represents a wholesale change in how auditors engage, assess risk, reach sufficient depth in their work, and address the complexity of providing an AI audit assurance opinion. Indeed, many of you are still trying to determine: \"How far do we go to render an opinion?\" For example, do you need to \"check the math?\" Will auditors need to understand and master increasingly technical capabilities to appropriately conduct work in AI? The answers to these questions are still evolving, however a starting point can be found in proven international frameworks for assessing and auditing emerging technologies. These can assist in ensuring that innovation is balanced with prudent risk controls and robust governance structures. More specifically, auditors can help companies manage data and AI risks by: assessing the monitoring and oversight for AI-generated outputs; assessing data classification for these outputs; reviewing controls for their retention and deletion; and evaluating data localisation and sovereignty compliance programs. First principles APRA is often asked whether we intend to regulate the use of AI by our regulated entities. We have stepped up our monitoring of the emerging AI risks by reviewing practices across some larger institutions, including the appropriateness of risk management and oversight. Before the end of the year, we will undertake targeted supervisory engagements with a group of larger financial institutions to get a better understanding of leading industry practices and common challenges relating to AI. Beyond technical considerations, we are encouraging our regulated entities to think strategically about AI ethics and governance, particularly as generative AI removes traditional human guardrails from decision-making processes. This will require them to embed strong ethical frameworks and accountability mechanisms into their AI governance structures, ensuring human oversight remains meaningful even when automated systems operate with greater autonomy.” However, we remain of the view that our existing regulatory framework is sufficient to capture the use of AI by banks, insurers and super funds. These include our prudential standards and guidance on information security, operational risk management, data risk and general risk management. And this brings me to my most fundamental message today: risks may evolve as technology changes, but the broad principles of good risk management remain the same. As auditors and other compliance professionals, your job is to identify the areas of highest risk within your organisations, conduct reviews to ensure these risks are being mitigated, and speak up when they are not. That doesn’t mean auditors can safely ignore technological developments. Auditors must have a solid understanding of how new technologies work and what they mean to the organisation, so they can provide assurance to boards that risks in areas such as cybersecurity, data governance, system implementation, system recovery, and migration are mitigated. APRA expects internal audit to deliver independent, risk‑based assurance over an entity’s information‑security capability and control environment, proportionate to the threat landscape and the criticality of business services. When required, that means stepping in to directly test where no other effective mechanisms exist. In practice, this includes assessing whether the CPS 234 control‑testing program is well‑designed and operating effectively; and verifying the organisation’s ability to detect, respond and recover through plans and exercises. Given CPS 230’s emphasis on operational resilience and material service providers, internal audit should also evaluate outsourced arrangements end‑to‑end. Reporting should triangulate Line One and Two results, supplier attestations, and independent reviews, and provide clear opinions to the Board and Audit Committee on residual risk and whether governance and controls, for both the organisation and the service provider, meet prudential expectations. Back to basics Australia’s financial services industry has come a long way since that first bank opened back in 1817. In those days, transferring money from London to Sydney required a sea journey of up to four months. 6 Today, it happens almost instantaneously via digital transfer. Technological innovation has markedly upped the convenience available to companies and their customers – and eliminated the threat, at least in banking, of shipwrecks and pirates – but other dangers have emerged: cyber criminals, network outages, crashed servers, human error, and data breaches. While the tools available to our financial forebears were rudimentary – quill pens, printing presses, cast iron safes and oil lamps – they were simple to understand and repair when things went wrong. The same can’t be said about many of the increasingly sophisticated, algorithmic-based technologies used by modern financial institutions. Not only are these technologies typically opaque, even for IT and cyber professionals, but they frequently rely on a range of interconnected third parties. With outdated legacy systems raising the risk of malfunctions and cyber breaches, most APRA-regulated entities are embracing new technologies to remain competitive and meet customer demands around service and efficiency. As they do so, internal audit has a crucial role to play in ensuring governance, control frameworks, and risk management keep pace with these changes. Because while technology is ever-changing, getting the basics right, and the principles of good risk management, are largely timeless.

    "ai_summary": "This speech by APRA Member Suzanne Smith to the Financial Services and ASX Sector Assurance Forum 2025 highlights the critical importance of technology risk management in the modern financial services industry. She emphasizes that financial institutions are increasingly reliant on complex technological systems, making them effectively technology companies, and therefore must prioritize robust risk management practices. Key areas of focus include cybersecurity, legacy systems, digital transformation, and third-party dependencies.\nHere are the key takeaways for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Cybersecurity Gaps Persist:** Despite increased awareness, significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities remain across the financial system. Key areas of concern include incomplete asset identification, inadequate authentication controls, sporadic third-party security assurance, inconsistent testing, and insufficient incident response preparedness. APRA expects prompt notification of cyber incidents, even with incomplete information.\n*   **Legacy Systems Pose Risks:** Reliance on outdated software and hardware creates vulnerabilities due to weaker security controls and difficulties in integration with modern systems. Underinvestment in IT infrastructure and delayed upgrades can lead to significant operational disruptions and financial losses. Internal audit should highlight the hidden costs of maintaining legacy systems.\n*   **Third-Party Concentration Risk:** The growing dependence on a concentrated set of technology vendors (cloud, SaaS, etc.) introduces significant concentration risk. A failure at one of these providers could disrupt services across multiple institutions. CPS 230 requires comprehensive understanding of supply chain vulnerabilities and robust contingency plans.\n*   **Digital Transformation Requires Vigilance:** Accelerated adoption of new technologies (SaaS, AI, blockchain) can outpace internal skills and governance frameworks, leading to ineffective implementations and increased risk. Thorough risk assessments and robust controls are essential for all digital initiatives.\n*   **Internal Audit's Role:** Internal audit plays a crucial role in ensuring fundamental controls are in place, particularly around workforce planning, employee engagement, and digital transformation initiatives. They should also scrutinize cost-cutting strategies that may compromise technology investments and operational readiness.",

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA revises governance proposals following industry consultation Friday 24 October 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has provided an update on its consultation to modernise the prudential framework on governance for banks, insurers and superannuation trustees. In March, APRA proposed eight measures to update its cross-industry prudential standards and guidance on governance for the first time in more than a decade. During the three-month consultation period, APRA held 57 meetings and roundtables involving over 150 stakeholder organisations and received almost 80 written submissions. Through these engagements, APRA received broad support for the package overall, especially for initiatives that can reduce burden and address regulatory overlap. But APRA also heard caution around the potential impact of some proposals. Having carefully considered this feedback, APRA has today written to industry advising it will modify three of its original proposals to ensure they don’t impose undue regulatory constraint on boards: Instead of a tenure limit for non-executive directors of 10 years with the possibility of a two-year extension, APRA now proposes a hard tenure limit of 12 years with short extensions in limited circumstances. A proposal for banks and insurers to have at least two independent directors (including the chair) not on other group boards will not proceed as originally proposed. A proposal to require significant financial institutions to engage early with APRA on responsible person appointments and succession planning will also not proceed. APRA will also clarify or adjust proposals relating to individual director skills, perceived conflicts of interest, and publication of registers of relevant interests and duties. Chair John Lonsdale said APRA remains committed to uplifting standards of governance in banking, insurance and superannuation. “Effective governance is fundamental to financial stability and sound risk management. Across our regulated industries, APRA continues to see cases where deficient governance leads to poor prudential outcomes. “However, in strengthening standards of governance, we want to strike a balance between increased prescription in some areas and making sure we retain sufficient flexibility for different business models. “We have benefited from the range of feedback from consultation, and today’s update demonstrates that we have listened carefully to the views of stakeholders. These changes will still deliver the uplift in governance standards APRA is seeking but we have found an outcome that works better for all parties. “APRA will continue to engage with industry as we work towards releasing updated prudential standards and guidance for further consultation in the first half of next year.” Today’s letter is available on the APRA website at: Governance review update .

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA proposes more accessible pathway to IRB accreditation for banks Thursday 23 October 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has proposed a simpler, clearer and more streamlined pathway for banks to become accredited to use the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to calculating credit risk-weighted assets. The IRB method is one of two approaches banks can use to calculate risk-weighted assets, which determines the amount of regulatory capital they need to hold for credit risk. 1 While the vast majority of banks use the standardised approach, APRA has approved six of the largest banks to use the IRB approach. 2 The IRB approach can provide a small financial benefit to banks by marginally reducing their capital requirements. However, accreditation to use the IRB approach requires banks to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in their risk management practices that has historically been too resource-intensive for most banks to achieve. Noting that some medium-sized banks have expressed interest in obtaining IRB accreditation, APRA is seeking to make the pathway to IRB accreditation more accessible for these banks. This was one of the commitments APRA made as part of the recent Council of Financial Regulators’ and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Review into Small and Medium-sized Banks . In a consultation paper released today, APRA has proposed a range of changes to the IRB accreditation pathway designed to help more banks access the IRB approach. APRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said the proposed changes are further evidence of APRA’s commitment to “getting the balance right” in its regulatory settings. “Capital is the cornerstone of every bank’s financial resilience so it’s essential banks can accurately align their capital requirements with the risks they face. “For most banks, the simpler and more conservative standardised approach to calculating risk weighted assets is the most cost-effective way for them to do this. But we recognise that a cohort of mid-sized banks have told us that gaining IRB accreditation would help them compete more effectively with the largest banks, especially for home loans. “While we don’t intend to drop our standards, the changes we are proposing today would improve the flexibility and transparency of the accreditation process, thereby supporting banks to more confidently plan, invest and transition, should they wish to,” Ms McCarthy Hockey said.

    "full_text": "Speeches Deputy Chair Margaret Cole - Remarks to the FSC Innovation in Retirement conference Thursday 16 October 2025 Print Email It’s a pleasure to be here and to have this opportunity to discuss APRA’s priorities for superannuation as the industry transitions to the retirement phase. This is one of my first public speaking engagements since the announcement of my decision to leave APRA by the end of my term in June next year. It has been, and continues to be, a privilege to oversee the industry at such a critical stage of its history. The superannuation industry is in a state of change driven by three powerful forces. The first, and the basis of many discussions at this forum today, is the ageing of the population and the implications that has for trustees and their members. Treasury has previously estimated that around 2.5 million Australians will transition from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase in this decade. How trustees respond to the challenge of supporting a sharply higher number of members in retirement will be a true test of the system. The second is the continued strong growth in superannuation assets. The system now has $4.3 trillion in assets, of which $3 trillion are held in APRA-regulated funds. That makes it the fourth largest pension system in the world behind that of the US, Canada and the UK, and, by some estimates, is on track to become the second largest by 2040. The expanding asset pool adds complexity for trustees in how they manage, invest, spend and safeguard their members’ monies. The third force is superannuation’s increasing significance to the broader financial system. The potential risks to financial stability arising from the increased interconnectedness of banking and superannuation are important to understand. We expect to publish the early findings from APRA’s inaugural system stress test, which evaluated those risks, later this year. When you factor in geopolitical instability, the rise in cyberattacks and fraud, as well as the growth in artificial intelligence, trustees have an extremely complex and fast-evolving operating environment to navigate. Before I delve into the detail of APRA’s priorities for super, it’s worth reflecting: where did this large complex system, which has become so important to the financial wellbeing of Australians in retirement, first begin? The introduction of the superannuation guarantee in 1992 was critical to the creation and rapid expansion of the universal compulsory superannuation system that we have today. However, the first employer-funded pension scheme came into being a full century and a half earlier. In 1842 the local directors of the fledging Australasian Bank wanted to find a way to retain their bank officers. So, they came up with the idea – and their UK-based proprietors agreed – to launch a bank-funded pension scheme. The scheme was formally approved at an annual meeting held in London in June of that year, with the first report of the meeting hitting the headlines of the Sydney Morning Herald 1 some four months later, such being the pace of international news at the time. To quote from the Herald article dated 8th of October 1842: “It appeared to the directors that the most effectual way of retaining the services of their officers would be to create a fund out of which pensions should be granted to those who, from age or length of meritorious service, or physical incapacity, might establish a claim to such a provision.” But it is what follows that I found of particular interest. The meeting report goes on to say – and, again, I quote: “It will be some years before a claim can arise to form a charge on this fund, and when that period approaches the directors will be prepared with a digested plan for its application.” In case of doubt let me assure you such a “we’ll worry about it later” approach would not hold much water with APRA today. Nor would it align with the spirit of the Retirement Income Covenant, which is central to one of APRA’s core strategic objectives: improved outcomes for superannuation members. The Retirement Income Covenant – a case for urgency The introduction of the Retirement Income Covenant more than three years ago represented a major nudge for the super industry. While the accumulation phase of superannuation continued to require trustees’ strong focus, it was critical that the industry should pay greater attention to supporting the needs of members in or approaching retirement. A core obligation under the covenant is for trustees to develop and implement retirement income strategies. But a year after the covenant came into effect, an APRA and ASIC joint thematic review identified a lack of urgency by trustees to meet their obligations. While we have seen progress and improvements since then, there is a clear and growing gap between trustees who are meeting baseline expectations and those who have embraced retirement as a strategic and competitive imperative. The case for having robust retirement income strategies is pressing. Our data shows that one in five funds have more than half of their members in or approaching retirement. However, over the next 20 years, this is expected to rise to around two in five funds. The initial thematic review was followed by an APRA-ASIC pulse check survey last year, which explored the progress trustees were making to implement the recommendations arising from the review. Yet again, we were concerned to find a lack of progress, this time in the tracking and measuring the success of retirement income strategies, despite this being a core recommendation. Our latest joint pulse check was conducted earlier this year. How much progress has been made, and where there is still room for improvement, will be outlined in the survey findings, due for release next month. Meeting members needs Understanding the needs of members, and tailoring support to help them balance the objectives of maximising income, managing risks, and flexible access, lies at the heart of the covenant. This includes providing access to quality information to support member decision-making at the point of retirement. While some funds are doing a good job at this, we believe there are still many members who could benefit from greater access to easy-to-understand information about the products, services and choices available to them. Our data suggests that large numbers of retirement-age members remain in accumulation phase products paying tax where, depending on their personal circumstances, they are likely to be better off in the tax-free retirement phase. For example, $99 billion of assets in MySuper accounts are held in the accounts of members aged 65 or over. In terms of products, APRA is doing its part to support greater product innovation in meeting the specific and various needs of members. APRA recently consulted with the life insurance industry on proposals to reduce capital requirements for insurers offering annuity products. APRA’s aim is to lower the cost to life insurers of providing annuity products, helping to attract participants and support growth in the market, so that more members can consider this type of product where suitable for their individual circumstances. APRA will commence a second consultation on these reforms shortly and aims to finalise the proposed changes in the first half of next year. The bigger picture The oncoming wave of members entering retirement will bring a substantial increase in assets in the retirement phase of super. Our latest estimates are that assets in retirement products will swell from $575 billion to around $3 trillion in 20 years’ time. Trustees will need to be prepared to manage the significant risk that this represents: Cyber risk, operational risk, investment risk, liquidity risk immediately spring to mind. The credential stuffing cyberattacks that targeted individual superannuation members at several different funds earlier year were contained. But their occurrence exposed persistent weaknesses in authentication practices across the industry. They also indicated that the super system was in the sights of threat actors. Unlike members in the accumulation phase, those in retirement can access their super savings which increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks, scams and fraud. A continuing priority for APRA is to ensure that regulated entities have robust information controls in place, including – but not limited to - multi factor authentication for member accounts. For me, the urgency for planning and action on cyber protections was further emphasised this week by the Australian Signals Directorate. As reported in the media, the directorate has warned that developments in quantum computing could break the encryption used to protect passwords within five years. It’s a sobering thought. Given the growing reliance on third parties, rapid technological advancements and geopolitical uncertainty, effective implementation of APRA’s operational risk management standard CPS 230 – particularly those requirements relating to oversight of material service providers – is critical to maintaining financial safety and stability. We will continue to engage with trustees to ensure they are meeting their new obligations. With more assets to invest, trustees are increasingly looking to overseas investment options as well as private unlisted assets to drive returns for members. Increased overseas deployment heightens, among other things, currency risk and increased investment in unlisted assets raises questions about the management of liquidity risk and fair valuation. Transparency Greater industry transparency will further improve outcomes for members. APRA is committed to increasing transparency of retirement product performance and the industry’s progress in implementing the Retirement Income Covenant. We now publish fund-level data on retirement product investment returns and investment strategies. APRA will integrate this data into our Comprehensive Product Performance Package from the second half of 2025-26. This will provide a more comprehensive view of product performance across the superannuation sector. APRA is also working with Treasury to design a new reporting framework on retirement outcomes, which will commence in 2027. This initiative will enable monitoring of the outcomes delivered to members in retirement in a consistent and transparent way. The next step with the Retirement Reporting Framework is for Government to confirm the scope of the framework, following the consultation undertaken by Treasury earlier this year. Getting the balance right Avid readers of APRA’s Corporate Plan 2 will be aware that we added a new strategic objective this year – Getting the Balance Right. This is about our need to balance our financial safety and stability objectives with competition and efficiency considerations. Under that objective we are progressing nine actions to minimise regulatory burden. In addition to the reduction of capital requirements for annuity products which I mentioned earlier, the initiatives include introducing further proportionality, removing unnecessary or duplicative rules, and strengthening data sharing with other agencies. The world is watching The push to improve financial outcomes for fund members in retirement is not unique to Australia. Many jurisdictions around the world are focused on retirement funding for their own ageing populations. But what does set our system apart from many others is the maturity of our compulsory defined contribution system which supports a constant flow of new capital into the superannuation system. The UK, which has previously relied to a greater extent in recent years on a defined benefit system, is transitioning towards a defined contributions model. The development of the UK’s Value for Money framework for defined contribution pension funds, has taken into account Australia’s approach and experience. The strong interest in our system was also evident in my recent meetings with UK pension authorities and regulators and at last month’s International Organisation of Pension Regulators sessions. Conclusion In closing, Australia’s superannuation system is, in many respects, the envy of the world. But we know it’s not perfect. It introduces complexity at a time in members’ lives when they don’t want complexity. To keep superannuation a world class system, trustees need to respond to the challenges arising from the three powerful drivers of change that are shaping the industry. That means doing more to improve outcomes for members in retirement. Doing more to build operational resilience as the system continues to expand. And doing more to understand the systemic significance of superannuation, not just at a fund level, but in the context of the broader financial system. Trustees must be equipped and capable to meet the challenges – both risks and opportunities lie ahead. Thank you Footnotes 1. The Sydney Morning Herald Sat 8 October 1842 08 Oct 1842 - Trove 2.

The Points of Presence Statistics are a detailed listing of the physical banking service channels provided to Australians, including branches, ATMs and EFTPOS facilities. As the national data collection agency for the financial sector, APRA collects points of presence information from ADIs and publishes it annually. The latest statistics show the ongoing trend of a decline in physical points of presence over the last year, albeit at a slower rate than previous years. The number of bank branches nationwide fell 4.6 per cent between June 2024 and June 2025. Regional and remote areas experienced the smallest fall recorded since this data series began (1.9 per cent), due in part to a moratorium on regional branch closures agreed between the Government and major banks in February this year. These statistics do not cover the entirety of banking service channels. Trends in physical banking service channels provided by ADIs should be considered in the broader context of increased usage of digital banking services and the presence of other service providers. APRA encourages industry bodies to work together to provide increased transparency on this matter. For example, as the industry association for the payments system, the Australian Payments Network publishes data on ATMs, including those operated by third parties. APRA has also concluded its review of Points of Presence data for ADIs. Further details are available in APRA’s response letter .

This was part of a global survey that involved central banks and authorities from 52 jurisdictions and was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to obtain comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of FX and OTC derivatives markets. Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986 for activity in FX markets and since 1995 for OTC interest rate derivatives markets. Globally, the Australian dollar is the seventh most traded currency, down from sixth in the previous survey, and its share of turnover remained stable around 6 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the sixth most traded currency pair globally, accounting for around 5 per cent of all transactions. Activity in Australia’s FX market in April 2025 reached its highest level on record. The survey was conducted during a period of heightened FX volatility and a surge of trading activity following several trade policy announcements by major economies. Average daily turnover in Australia’s FX market increased by 34 per cent to US$201 billion per day in April 2025, from US$150 billion in April 2022. [1] Australia’s FX market remains the the 11th largest in the world. In the Australian FX market the majority of turnover remained in FX swaps, accounting for around 53 per cent of total turnover. Spot transactions accounted for 25 per cent of Australian turnover, up from 23 per cent in 2022, and outright forwards accounted for 18 per cent of Australian turnover, little changed from the previous survey. Activity in the Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased sharply since the previous survey. Average daily turnover in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased by 123 per cent to US$252 billion during April 2022, reflecting an increase in turnover of interest rate swaps. The preliminary results of the global turnover survey are available from the BIS website. The final data and related analysis will be released by the BIS in December 2025. Links to other participating jurisdictions’ results are available from the BIS website.

    "full_text": "Media Release Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision Number 2025-27 Date 30 September 2025 At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent. The decline in underlying inflation has slowed. Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. Both headline and trimmed mean inflation were within the 2–3 per cent range in the June quarter. Recent data, while partial and volatile, suggest that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of the August Statement on Monetary Policy . Domestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain. Data for the June quarter show that private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected, taking over from public demand as the driver of growth. In particular, private consumption is picking up as real household incomes rise and measures of financial conditions ease. The housing market is strengthening, a sign that recent interest rate decreases are having an effect. Credit is readily available to both households and businesses. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions have been broadly steady in recent months and remain a little tight. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected, but the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 per cent in August. Measures of labour underutilisation remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour has been little changed of late. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but productivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both domestic and international developments. On the domestic side, stronger-than-expected data on growth and inflation may indicate that households have become more comfortable consuming as real incomes and wealth rise. If this continues, it may make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases and lead to more demand for labour. Alternatively, the recent growth in consumption might not persist, particularly if households become more concerned about overseas developments. Uncertainty in the global economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on global economic growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat to the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions in the domestic economy. There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing, the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and the outlook for productivity. Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority. With signs that private demand is recovering, indications that inflation may be persistent in some areas and labour market conditions overall remaining stable, the Board decided that it was appropriate to maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the beginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full effects of earlier cash rate reductions. The Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of uncertainty about the outlook. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Decision Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

    "full_text": "Media Release Assessment of ASX Clearing and Settlement Facilities – September 2025 Number 2025-25 Date 24 September 2025 The Reserve Bank of Australia today released the 2025 Assessment of the ASX Clearing and Settlement (CS) Facilities . This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank’s Financial Stability Standards (Standards). ASX has considerable work to do to meet the Bank’s expectations for an operator of critical market infrastructure. Recent shortcomings in risk management – particularly the December 2024 CHESS batch settlement incident – have highlighted that ASX must make foundational changes to its governance, culture and risk management processes. ASX must also accelerate its uplift of operational and financial risk management, while meeting key milestones for its major technology projects. Delivering on these initiatives will require appropriate resourcing and the RBA will be closely monitoring progress over the coming year. The ASX CS facilities were rated as having ‘observed’ or ‘broadly observed’ many of the individual Standards. The Bank assessed that one or more of the CS facilities ‘partly observed’ requirements under the specific Standards on the Framework for Comprehensive Management of Risks, Governance, Credit Risk, Settlement Finality, and Operational Risk. ASX Clear and ASX Settlement continue to be rated as ‘not observed’ on the Operational Risk Standard, following the Bank’s out-of-cycle assessment against this Standard in March 2025. The Bank has issued a number of recommendations, including that ASX should: obtain assurance that it has addressed gaps in its risk appetite statement and strategy to return to risk appetite ensure its risk transformation plan is appropriately resourced and implement regular reporting on the plan conduct a review of business continuity and contingency arrangement across the CS facilities comprehensively improve data and reporting controls for financial risk models and address issues identified in the assessment period. RBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said: ‘ASX is not currently meeting the regulators’ expectations for an operator of critical national infrastructure. Resilient and secure CS facilities are crucial to the stability of the Australian financial system. ‘This assessment highlights that ASX still has more work to do to in strengthening its governance, risk culture, and frameworks for managing operational and financial risk. We are expecting meaningful progress over the coming year and will consider further regulatory responses if necessary.’ Background The Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on financial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed on a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards determined by the Bank. The Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX’s four CS facilities: two central counterparties – ASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited – and two securities settlement facilities – ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited. These assessments include a rating of the CS facilities’ observance against each financial stability standard. For more information on the Bank’s approach to assessing CS facilities, see: The Reserve Bank’s Approach to Supervising and Assessing Clearing and Settlement Facility Licensees . ASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the supervision of CS facilities. In carrying out supervision of CS facilities, the RBA works closely with ASIC.

    "full_text": "Media Release Payments System Board Update: August 2025 Meeting Number 2025-23 Date 28 August 2025 At its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including: The regulatory response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024. The Board reviewed ASX’s plans to ensure the current CHESS is adequately operated, maintained and supported as a critical financial market infrastructure. Members noted that early progress is being made and agreed that significant concerns remain. The Board also agreed on further regulatory steps to ensure CHESS Replacement is designed with an appropriate level of resilience for critical financial market infrastructure. The annual Assessment of the ASX clearing and settlement facilities against the Financial Stability Standards . The Board endorsed the RBA’s Assessment, which will be published after it has been provided to ASX, the Treasurer and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Members observed that ASX has made limited progress in addressing the RBA’s fundamental concerns in relation to operational resilience and risk management over the past year. ASX’s response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024 and its aftermath has also demonstrated that ASX must take urgent steps to improve its governance and risk culture. The successful delivery of ASX’s current risk management, technology and transformation initiatives is crucial to the continuity of services that are critical to the stability of the Australian financial system. The RBA’s oversight of international financial market infrastructures , including LCH SwapClear, CME, Clearstream Banking, Euroclear Bank, CLS and Swift. Many of these infrastructures are engaged in complex, multi-year transformation programs to modernise systems and enhance resilience. Members emphasised the importance of strong project governance, testing and migration strategies to support the ongoing safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. Members also discussed the risks associated with growing reliance by financial market infrastructures on a small number of critical third-party service providers. The Board welcomed ASIC’s decision to grant Clearstream Banking a clearing and settlement facility licence. Members highlighted the importance of the RBA and ASIC, as co-regulators of clearing and settlement facilities operating in Australia, having sufficient oversight of such facilities. The system-wide resilience of the Australian payments system. The Board highlighted the growing importance of operational resilience in the context of a more complex and challenging environment for operational risk in the payments system. Regulators and entities will need to increase their focus on system-wide interdependencies. The Board endorsed an ongoing research program examining interoperability, third-party and concentration risks, resilience arrangements for high-value payments and the vulnerability of the payments system to utilities outages. The future of cash distribution arrangements. Members discussed the challenges in the cash distribution system. There is an ongoing need for industry cooperation to work towards a more durable future distribution system that supports the availability of cash in the community, including in rural and regional Australia. Cash remains an important means of payment for many Australians and can play a valuable role as a back-up to electronic payments, as part of a resilient and inclusive payments ecosystem. Members noted that a new proposed regulatory framework for providers of cash distribution services, which was the subject of a recent CFR and ACCC consultation, should contribute to the management of risks relating to the continuity of cash distribution services across Australia. Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging. The Board was provided with an update on the initial responses of stakeholders to the Consultation Paper published in July. Members noted feedback regarding the potential impact of the proposed card payments regulations on the ability of small issuers and fintechs to compete and innovate. Members held a preliminary discussion on whether there is a case to reduce the regulatory burden of card payments regulations on small issuers and what options might best support this objective. The issue will be considered further as part of the consultation process for the Review. Global developments in stablecoins. Members discussed the recent sharp growth in the global stablecoin market, noting the market is largely concentrated in a small number of US dollar stablecoins. Members discussed the expansion in potential use cases for stablecoins, including as a means of payment and in cross-border transactions. They also considered the emerging regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. While the stablecoin market in Australia is currently very small, members discussed a range of potential domestic implications if the use of stablecoins were to grow considerably. The Board also welcomed the Government’s proposed reforms aimed at ensuring that stored-value facilities, including stablecoins, operate under a strong regulatory and licencing regime.

    "full_text": "Media Release Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision Number 2025-22 Date 12 August 2025 At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60 per cent. Inflation has continued to moderate. Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. In the June quarter, trimmed mean inflation over the year fell to 2.7 per cent, broadly as expected in May. Headline inflation, which has partly been affected by temporary cost of living relief measures, was 2.1 per cent, also as forecast. Updated staff forecasts for the August meeting suggest that underlying inflation will continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a gradual easing path. The outlook remains uncertain. Uncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on global economic activity, and there remains a risk that households and firms delay expenditure pending still greater clarity on the outlook. As in May, the forecasts assume that both effects weigh on activity and inflation in Australia for a period. Domestically, private demand appears to have been recovering gradually, real household incomes have picked up and some measures of financial conditions have eased. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, although have eased further in recent months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in the month of June and averaged 4.2 per cent in the June quarter as a whole, in line with the May forecasts. Measures of labour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour is still a constraint for a range of employers. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak but productivity growth has not picked up and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both domestic and international developments. The forecasts released today are for the recovery in household consumption growth to be sustained as real incomes rise. Businesses in some sectors, however, continue to report that weakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases to final prices. There is a risk that consumption growth is a little slower than expected, which could weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions. Alternatively, as real incomes and wealth continue to rise, households might choose to consume more and save less than expected. Labour market outcomes may also prove stronger than expected, given the signal from a range of leading indicators. There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how firms’ pricing decisions and wages will respond to the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and continued weak productivity outcomes. Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority. With underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent range and labour market conditions easing slightly, as expected, the Board judged that a further easing of monetary policy was appropriate. This takes the decline in the cash rate since the beginning of the year to 75 basis points. The Board nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty about both aggregate demand and potential supply. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.
