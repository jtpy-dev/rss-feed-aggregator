    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA publishes new report on financial system risks Thursday 20 November 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has launched a new report on APRA’s assessment of risks and vulnerabilities facing the Australian financial system. The new System Risk Outlook report, which will be published twice a year, increases transparency around what APRA is seeing in the domestic and international risk environments to inform its regulatory priorities. Key insights from this first publication include: Risks to the Australian financial system from overseas are heightened, and the geopolitical environment is expected to remain volatile for some time. While the system is well-placed to absorb potential shocks from overseas, this resilience could be eroded if institutions are not prepared for a wide range of scenarios. APRA and the other agencies on the Council of Financial Regulators are strengthening the system’s resilience through a dedicated geopolitical risk work program. APRA is closely monitoring any build-up of domestic vulnerabilities, particularly in the housing market, including high household debt. While overall housing lending standards remain sound, APRA is seeing some signs of a pick-up in higher risk lending, particularly high debt-to-income borrowing by investors. The increasing interconnectedness of the financial system has elevated the potential for shocks in one sector to have a system-wide impact. Today’s report also includes a summary of the findings from Phase 1 of APRA’s inaugural system risk stress test, which was undertaken this year with the four major banks and six large superannuation funds. The key findings from Phase 1 suggest that the structural features of super funds mean that the industry acts as an important stabiliser for the system during stress but, in some cases, their actions can also amplify the negative effect of the shock on members and the system. APRA Chair John Lonsdale said: “The insights from our System Risk Outlook report confirm that Australia’s financial system is stable, resilient and well-placed to absorb shocks, but they also emphasise why we can’t be complacent. International political and economic uncertainty remains elevated, which is why APRA is stepping up its focus on geopolitical risk. “Domestically, housing remains a key vulnerability, given high household debt and prices continuing to rise. We are carefully monitoring these risks and ensuring banks are prepared to implement additional macroprudential tools where required to reinforce lending standards.” “Our inaugural system risk stress test is an important addition to APRA’s stress testing regime by helping us better understand how linkages in the financial system could dampen or amplify shocks. We will shortly commence Phase 2 of the exercise, which will test the robustness of the Phase 1 findings and consider other areas of analysis,” Mr Lonsdale said. APRA expects to publish a final detailed report of the findings of the system risk stress test, incorporating Phase 2, in mid-2026.

APRA is addressing this through a dedicated geopolitical risk work program within the Council of Financial Regulators.\n*   **Domestic Housing Vulnerabilities:** APRA is closely monitoring the Australian housing market, particularly high household debt and rising prices.

Liberty Infrabuild Limited and its parent company Liberty Holdings Australia Pty Ltd, own or operate businesses involved in the manufacturing, distribution and processing of steel long products and the recycling of scrap steel in Australia and globally. In the 2024 financial year, the group’s sales revenue was $5.2 billion and the group had liabilities of $2.19 billion (excluding liabilities from related parties). After failing to lodge by 31 October 2024, ASIC commenced inquiries with various GFG Alliance companies. Liberty Infrabuild subsequently lodged its financial report on 23 May 2025 with a qualified audit opinion, and Liberty Holdings Australia lodged on 15 September 2025 with a disclaimer audit opinion. At the ASIC Annual Forum last week, ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court announced that financial reporting misconduct, including failure to lodge financial reports, would be an enforcement priority for ASIC in 2026. ‘These reports provide critical information for investors, creditors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. ‘Delays in lodgement undermine market transparency and confidence, particularly where audit reports are modified or subject to disclaimer opinions,’ the Deputy Chair said. Payment of an infringement notice does not constitute an admission of guilt or liability, and the companies are not regarded as having been convicted of the alleged offence. ASIC notes that both companies lodged their FY25 audited financial reports on time. Background GFG Alliance is a global group of businesses in industries including steel, aluminium, and energy. GFG Alliance has significant operations in Australia, including Infrabuild, Whyalla Steelworks in South Australia run by OneSteel Manufacturing Pty Limited (which is currently in voluntary administration), Tahmoor Coal in New South Wales, and Liberty Bell Bay in Tasmania. Separate civil proceedings were commenced in the Supreme Court of NSW in June 2025 against Whyalla Steelworks’ parent Liberty Primary Metals Australia Pty Ltd (now in voluntary administration), Tahmoor Coal Pty Ltd, and Liberty Bell Bay Pty Ltd for their failure to lodge various annual financial reports at the time the proceedings were commenced. The current status of these proceedings are outlined in ASIC’s media release: 25-141MR Three GFG Alliance Group companies ordered to lodge outstanding annual reports with ASIC . Infringement notices ASIC may issue an infringement notice if we believe, on reasonable grounds, that there has been a contravention of an infringement notice provision. A company has an obligation to lodge audited financial reports with ASIC under s319(1) of the Corporations Act and contravention is an offence of strict liability. Based on the applicable penalty units at the time of the alleged offence, the maximum penalty a court can impose is $375,600 for each offence. Strict liability offences in the Corporations Act are infringement notice provisions and are issued at half the maximum penalty that a court could impose for the contravention.

This represents a 16 per cent increase in losses and a 20 per cent decrease in reports compared to the same period last year.</p>\n\n<p>As Australians engage with Black Friday sales, shoppers are urged to stay alert for scams disguised as genuine deals. Shopping scams were the most reported scam type involving financial loss so far this year, with 9,628 of the total 19,662 reports received resulting in $8.6 million in losses. This was an increase of 19 per cent in reported losses from the same period in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>“Scammers love Black Friday sales too because they know shoppers are looking for bargains and they rely on creating urgency and pressure that can come with a busy shopping period,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>“We remind consumers to take their time, check the legitimacy of websites and its offers, and be cautious about sharing personal or financial information online. A few simple checks before making a purchase can make all the difference in avoiding a scam and keeping your money safe.”</p>\n\n<p>Online content, such as fake websites, advertisements, social media, and mobile apps, were the most common method used by scammers for initial contact, resulting in $122 million in losses, or 47 per cent of overall scam losses.</p>\n\n<p>Some shopping scams involve the compromise of social media accounts to reach unsuspecting victims. Compromised social media accounts are increasingly used by scammers to target victims’ personal networks, particularly on Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>After gaining access, scammers impersonate the account holder to promote scams such as fake ticket sales, ‘fire sales’, grant offers, and investment schemes.</p>\n\n<p>They further compromise friends’ accounts by requesting one-time codes under false pretences, enabling a chain of account takeovers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"media media--type-accc-image media--view-mode-accc-large-thumbnail\">\n      <img alt=\"Compromised social media account scams\" class=\"img-fluid image-style-large\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/sites/www.accc.gov.au/files/styles/large/public/2025-11/Social%20media%20account%20compromise%20.png?itok=l9j2veSJ\" title=\"Scammers use compromised social media account\" width=\"262\" />\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p><sub>Example of a social media post from a compromised account, advertising a ‘fire sale’ of items.</sub></p>\n\n<p>\"We continue to urge Australians to verify who they are communicating with online, as scammers leverage trusted relationships and social platforms to manipulate people into handing over money and personal information,” Ms Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>“You should be aware that online friend accounts can be compromised, so avoid clicking on any links and always do your own checks before paying money. A good way to check is to contact them through another means, such as by phone or text message. This can also alert your friend so they can take prompt action to recover their account.”</p>\n\n<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre is also seeing more people report financial loss among vulnerable communities; with a 12 per cent rise for people with a disability, 35 per cent for those who speak English as a second language, and 50 percent for First Nations people.</p>\n\n<p>Scamwatch website recently published resources for people to <a href=\"https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stop-check-protect/help-someone-whos-being-scammed/red-flags-checklist-for-family-and-friends\">provide support</a> to loved ones who may be targeted by scammers, including <a href=\"https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stop-check-protect/help-someone-whos-being-scammed/red-flags-checklist-for-family-and-friends\">red flag signs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stop-check-protect/help-someone-whos-being-scammed/conversation-starters-for-family-and-friends\">conversation starters</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stop-check-protect/help-someone-whos-being-scammed/understanding-how-scammers-manipulate-your-loved-one\">manipulation tactics</a> deployed by scammers.</p>\n\n<p>“We strongly encourage people to check in with their loved ones and start the conversation about scams. Scammers are criminals who target anyone,” Ms Lowe said.</p>\n\n<p>“Starting an honest conversation about scams can take away the fear and embarrassment that often stop people from speaking up. Listening with compassion and without judgement helps them feel supported and understood.”</p>\n\n<p>“We’re grateful to everyone who reports scams to Scamwatch, even if they haven’t lost money.

    "full_text": "Date 18 November 2025 Topics Scams Australians reported nearly $260 million in losses to scams in the first nine months of 2025, with the National Anti-Scam Centre warning that online shopping scams are on the rise. Between January and September 2025, the National Anti-Scam Centre’s Scamwatch service received 159,319 scam reports with financial losses of $259.5 million. This represents a 16 per cent increase in losses and a 20 per cent decrease in reports compared to the same period last year. As Australians engage with Black Friday sales, shoppers are urged to stay alert for scams disguised as genuine deals. Shopping scams were the most reported scam type involving financial loss so far this year, with 9,628 of the total 19,662 reports received resulting in $8.6 million in losses. This was an increase of 19 per cent in reported losses from the same period in 2024. “Scammers love Black Friday sales too because they know shoppers are looking for bargains and they rely on creating urgency and pressure that can come with a busy shopping period,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “We remind consumers to take their time, check the legitimacy of websites and its offers, and be cautious about sharing personal or financial information online. A few simple checks before making a purchase can make all the difference in avoiding a scam and keeping your money safe.” Online content, such as fake websites, advertisements, social media, and mobile apps, were the most common method used by scammers for initial contact, resulting in $122 million in losses, or 47 per cent of overall scam losses. Some shopping scams involve the compromise of social media accounts to reach unsuspecting victims. Compromised social media accounts are increasingly used by scammers to target victims’ personal networks, particularly on Facebook and Instagram. After gaining access, scammers impersonate the account holder to promote scams such as fake ticket sales, ‘fire sales’, grant offers, and investment schemes. They further compromise friends’ accounts by requesting one-time codes under false pretences, enabling a chain of account takeovers. Example of a social media post from a compromised account, advertising a ‘fire sale’ of items. \"We continue to urge Australians to verify who they are communicating with online, as scammers leverage trusted relationships and social platforms to manipulate people into handing over money and personal information,” Ms Lowe said. “You should be aware that online friend accounts can be compromised, so avoid clicking on any links and always do your own checks before paying money. A good way to check is to contact them through another means, such as by phone or text message. This can also alert your friend so they can take prompt action to recover their account.” The National Anti-Scam Centre is also seeing more people report financial loss among vulnerable communities; with a 12 per cent rise for people with a disability, 35 per cent for those who speak English as a second language, and 50 percent for First Nations people. Scamwatch website recently published resources for people to provide support to loved ones who may be targeted by scammers, including red flag signs , conversation starters and the manipulation tactics deployed by scammers. “We strongly encourage people to check in with their loved ones and start the conversation about scams. Scammers are criminals who target anyone,” Ms Lowe said. “Starting an honest conversation about scams can take away the fear and embarrassment that often stop people from speaking up. Listening with compassion and without judgement helps them feel supported and understood.” “We’re grateful to everyone who reports scams to Scamwatch, even if they haven’t lost money. Each report helps us build a clearer picture of scam activity and strengthens our work with other organisations to disrupt these criminal networks.” Other scam trends Investment scams were the cause of the highest overall reported losses in the first nine months of 2025, totalling $128.4 million. However, investment scams was one of the few scam categories where the losses showed a decrease from the same period in 2024 (down from $135 million). There was a 50 per cent decrease in reports about rebate scams, dropping from 3,236 reports in 2024 to 1,628 reports in 2025. There were 11,602 reports of false billing scams in 2025 compared to 24,139 in 2024, which was a 52 per cent decrease. In 2025, there were $19.4 million in reported losses to false billing scams compared to $11.3 million in 2024. There was also a 47 per cent drop in reports about remote access scams from 2024 to 2025. Losses to these scams also decreased by 30 per cent; down from $5.9 million in 2024 to $4.2 million in the same period in 2025. Remote access scams disproportionately impact older Australians. There were 52,753 reports of phishing scams made to Scamwatch in 2025, down from 80,119 in 2024. This is a decrease of 34 percent. Learn how to Stop. Check. Protect. to stay safe from scams: STOP.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Thousands of Australians were exposed to poor financial advice and significant risks from the Shield Master Fund (Shield) and First Guardian Master Fund (First Guardian) through critical oversight and compliance failures by Interprac Financial Planning Pty Ltd (Interprac), ASIC alleges in new proceedings filed today with the Federal Court. ASIC has commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Interprac for allegedly failing to ensure its former authorised representatives Venture Egg (a corporate partnership), and Rhys Reilly Pty Ltd (together, Representatives), complied with the best interests obligations and for failing to have adequate risk management systems. Together, these Representatives advised around 6,843 clients to invest around $677 million of their superannuation into Shield and First Guardian. Both funds have now collapsed, leaving people’s superannuation at risk. ASIC alleges Interprac failed to: have in place an adequate process for approving financial products it allowed onto its approved product list, including Shield and First Guardian, and relied entirely on external research to add those funds to its approved investments list for advisers; respond appropriately to the use of lead generators (being Imperial Capital Group Australia Pty Ltd and AGAT Business Pty Ltd (in liquidation)); respond adequately to news that payments had been made to Mr Ferras Merhi’s companies by entities associated with First Guardian and Shield; enforce or maintain a hold on new investments into Shield and First Guardian after Interprac’s Managing Director and Responsible Manager, Garry Crole, acknowledged serious issues with both funds; prevent the use of a ‘negative consent’ practice, which led to some clients’ superannuation being invested in Shield and/or First Guardian without express consent from those clients; respond adequately to significant inflows of investment into Shield and First Guardian; provide adequate responses to client complaints about advice from the Representatives to invest in Shield or First Guardian and instead relied on a ‘template’ response which often failed to consider the appropriateness of the advice; and respond adequately or impose meaningful consequences in response to serious compliance issues, including failings repeatedly identified in audits. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said ‘Interprac’s alleged oversight and compliance failures exposed thousands of Australians to poor advice and significant financial risk. ‘We allege Interprac failed to ensure certain authorised representatives acted in their clients’ best interests, contributing to hundreds of millions of dollars of superannuation being invested in products that were unsuitable, high risk and costly. ‘We allege that no competent financial adviser could have recommended Australians invest large amounts of their superannuation in these funds, and that Interprac – as licensee – should have been alert and responsive to the significant risk this conduct posed to clients, but it failed on many levels,’ the Deputy Chair said. ASIC is seeking declarations, civil penalties, and orders to restrain Interprac from carrying on a financial services business. Background Effective 31 May 2025, Mr Ferras Merhi and Venture Egg are no longer authorised representatives of Interprac. Effective 15 August 2025, Mr Rhys Reilly and Rhys Reilly Pty Ltd are no longer authorised representatives of Interprac.

The suit centers on Interprac's alleged failures in ensuring its representatives acted in clients' best interests and in maintaining adequate risk management systems. Here are the key allegations and implications:\n*   **Breach of Best Interests Duty:** ASIC alleges Interprac failed to ensure its representatives complied with their best interests obligations when advising clients to invest in Shield and First Guardian, leading to approximately $677 million of superannuation being invested in these funds.\n*   **Inadequate Product Approval Process:** Interprac allegedly lacked a proper process for approving financial products, including Shield and First Guardian, for its approved product list, relying solely on external research.\n*   **Failure to Respond to Red Flags:** ASIC claims Interprac failed to adequately respond to warning signs, including the use of lead generators, payments to related parties, and internal concerns about the funds.\n*   **Compliance Failures:** Interprac is accused of failing to enforce investment holds, prevent \"negative consent\" practices, address client complaints appropriately, and take meaningful action in response to repeated compliance issues identified in audits.\n*   **Potential Penalties:** ASIC is seeking declarations, civil penalties, and orders to restrain Interprac from carrying on a financial services business.",

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email SQM Research Pty Ltd ( SQM Research ) prepared reports containing misleading representations and its processes fell short of expected standards when it published “Favourable” ratings for the Shield Master Fund ( Shield ), ASIC alleges in new proceedings launched in the Federal Court. SQM Research published reports in October 2021, March 2022 and October 2022, that rated the different classes of Shield as “3¾ stars, Favourable”. ASIC alleges that SQM Research: failed to obtain the information it needed to properly assess Shield; failed to properly consider inconsistencies in information it received when preparing its reports about Shield; misrepresented that it had a reasonable basis for giving Shield a “Favourable” rating and had exercised reasonable care and skill in doing so; and made misrepresentations that understated the percentage of funds managed by parties related to Shield and the asset allocation of Shield. ASIC alleges that the SQM Research reports did not accurately depict the standard, quality, value or grade of Shield, and that reflected deficiencies in the processes SQM followed. The SQM Research reports were provided to financial advisers and superannuation trustees who recommended or onboarded Shield. Around 5,800 people invested their superannuation savings into Shield. In many cases, people invested in Shield after receiving advice from financial advisers. These advisers often told investors to roll over their existing superannuation balances into a choice superannuation fund available on a platform which had onboarded Shield. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said the civil penalty proceedings against SQM Research marked the first time the regulator had taken action against a research house. 'Research houses have a responsibility to ensure they obtain the information needed to prepare their reports, take real care and skill in assessing that information and to present that information accurately. ‘We believe research houses are important gatekeepers and form part of a critical line of defence against poor quality investments or unsuitable products. ‘Given the important role research houses play in rating funds and investments, the community is entitled to expect that their reports will be accurate and based on appropriate information and analysis,’ the Deputy Chair said. ASIC is seeking declarations and civil penalties from the Court. Background SQM Research holds an Australian financial services licence and is a provider of research on investment products. ASIC alleges SQM Research contravened s912A(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 and s12DB(1)(a) and 12DB(1)(e) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 . SQM Research charged Keystone Asset Management Ltd (in liq) (the responsible entity of Shield) fees for preparing the research reports. On 5 November 2025, ASIC released Report 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance ( REP 820 ), which highlighted the important function external research houses perform in the funds management sector and that research houses are expected to undertake rigorous due diligence to substantiate any ratings they issue. ASIC’s Regulatory Guide 79 Research report providers: Improving the quality of investment research ( RG 79 ), sets out clear expectations for research houses, emphasising their role as “important gatekeepers in the financial services industry.” The guide highlights that research report providers must ensure the integrity, quality, and transparency of their research, and that their reports are based on objective, verifiable facts and analysis. ASIC’s guidance aims to strengthen confidence in investment research and protect investors from poor-quality advice.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email MWL Financial Services Pty Ltd (administrators appointed) (MWL) operated a business model, involving its former director Nicholas Maikousis and lead generator Imperial Capital Group Australia Pty Ltd (Imperial), that provided inappropriate financial advice to clients to invest their superannuation into the Shield Master Fund (Shield), ASIC will seek to allege in the Federal Court. ASIC has sought leave to commence the proceeding to allege serious failings in relation to Imperial’s referral of clients to MWL and the financial advice given by MWL advisers. ASIC will seek to allege that: between May 2022 and February 2024, nine MWL representatives advised at least 556 clients to make initial investments of about $114 million of their superannuation into Shield; MWL failed to take reasonable steps to ensure its representatives acted in the best interests of its clients and provided appropriate advice in respect of recommendations that clients roll over their superannuation to invest into Shield as the pre-selected investment option; MWL failed to ensure its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly and failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest; Imperial, acting as a lead generator, made misleading representations to prospective clients about the standard, quality and benefits of MWL’s financial services and was involved in MWL’s alleged contravention of its obligation to provide financial services efficiently, honestly and fairly; MWL’s director, Nicholas Maikousis, was involved in MWL’s alleged contraventions of its general licensee obligations and its obligation to take reasonable steps to ensure its authorised representatives complied with their best interests and related duties; MWL received advice fees charged to clients for preparing Statements of Advice recommending investment in Shield; Imperial received (through a related entity) approximately $12.8 million in payments from entities associated with Shield for client referrals and the promotion of Shield. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said the superannuation of many Australians was put at risk by the conduct proposed to be alleged in this proceeding. ‘ASIC will seek to allege that MWL and Imperial were involved in a project which resulted in the superannuation of hundreds of Australians being invested into a high-risk scheme,’ the Deputy Chair said. The project allegedly involved Imperial referring prospective clients to MWL for what Imperial represented would be tailored financial advice, but which instead put clients into a pre-selected investment: Shield . ‘Instead of the tailored financial advice that was promised, we will seek to allege MWL provided pre-determined advice that was not in clients’ best interests. ‘Despite Shield having no proven track record, we will seek to allege clients were advised to invest most or almost all of their retirement savings into the fund, irrespective of their individual circumstances,’ the Deputy Chair said. Because MWL is in administration, ASIC’s application to make these allegations is subject to the Court’s approval (or the consent of the Administrators). If allowed to proceed, ASIC will seek declarations and civil penalties against all defendants, and orders disqualifying Mr Maikousis from managing corporations. Actions to consider if you are a client of MWL If you are a client of MWL and have concerns about the conduct of your adviser or the advice you received, you should consider lodging a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority ( AFCA ).

AFCA will consider your complaint if it meets the eligibility criteria. Important deadline: In cancelling MWL’s licence, ASIC required MWL to remain a member of AFCA until 25 August 2026 . If you intend to lodge a complaint with AFCA in relation to advice received from MWL you should do so by 25 August 2026 . Background ASIC will seek to allege that MWL contravened ss 912A(1)(a) and (aa), 961K(2) and 961L of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), that Imperial was involved in MWL’s contravention of s 912A(1)(a), that Mr Maikousis was involved in MWL’s contraventions of ss 912A(1)(a) and (aa) and 961L, and that Imperial contravened s 12DB of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth). On 30 September 2025, ASIC was notified that Daniel Juratowitch and Rachel Burdett of Cor Cordis were appointed as joint administrators of MWL as at 29 September 2025.

ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said ASIC’s 2026 enforcement priorities have been designed to protect consumers from financial harm and uphold the integrity of Australia’s financial markets. ‘We are continuing to deliver strong, visible and active enforcement outcomes. 'We’re doing more investigations, taking more matters to court and securing record penalties. ‘In the last 12 months, we’ve doubled the number of new investigations and nearly doubled the number of new matters filed in court. ‘We’ve also worked hard to increase our criminal prosecutions, and seen lengthy sentences imposed for financial fraud offences,’ the Deputy Chair said. In 2026, ASIC’s new enforcement priorities are: Misleading pricing practices impacting cost of living for Australians Poor private credit practices Financial reporting misconduct including failure to lodge financial reports Claims and complaint handling failures by insurers Continuing our work to hold those responsible to account for the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds Continuing enforcement priorities are: Strengthening investigation and prosecution of insider trading conduct Misconduct exploiting consumers facing financial difficulty including predatory credit practices Unlawful practices seeking to evade small business creditors Holding super trustees to account for member services failures Auditor misconduct ‘Our 2026 enforcement priorities reflect emerging risks like those in private credit, as well as the challenges Australians face while contending with higher living costs. ‘ASIC will zero in on misleading pricing practices in the financial services sector, particularly those that make everyday costs harder for Australians. ‘In line with our increased surveillance across private credit, we won’t hesitate to take enforcement action to stamp out misconduct in the sector so we can support confident and informed participation, investor protection and market integrity. ‘Reliable financial information remains more important than ever, particularly as entities with unlisted assets, such as super funds and private credit funds, play a bigger role in the economy. In 2026, we will step up enforcement action against financial reporting misconduct. Alongside these priorities, more than 40 people are continuing to investigate the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds and, as one of ASIC’s largest and most complex cases ever, it has been elevated to a new, dedicated priority. ‘We have been focused on returning available money to investors and the next stage is holding those responsible to account for the Shield and First Guardian collapses’, the Deputy Chair said. Key enforcement outcomes over the past year include: Proposing $240 million in combined penalties against ANZ which, if imposed by the court, would be the largest penalties ASIC has ever levelled against a single entity. Filing proceedings against Macquarie and accepting a court enforceable undertaking to repay $320 million to affected Shield Master Fund investors. Securing a 14-year prison sentence for West Australian fraudster Chris Marco; the highest sentence imposed by an Australian court in relation to an ASIC criminal investigation. ASIC’s enforcement priorities for 2026 are designed to send a clear and effective signal to the market about where ASIC will focus its resources and expertise. In addition to ASIC’s 2026 enforcement priorities, ASIC’s enduring priorities remain, including protecting First Nations and vulnerable consumers, upholding market integrity, acting against systemic failures, and ensuring a fair, strong, and efficient financial system for all Australians. Background ASIC’s goal is to help all Australians through promoting market integrity and consumer protection in the Australian financial system.

The ACCC’s review considered how closely Seven and Southern Cross compete across different markets, including in the supply of advertising opportunities, the supply of media content to consumers and the acquisition of media content from producers in Australia. In its investigation, the ACCC focussed on various local markets in regional Western Australia where Southern Cross and Seven are the main traditional media outlets offering advertising opportunities for local businesses. “We found that Southern Cross and Seven attract different advertisers and are not close competitors for the supply of advertising opportunities in these regions,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. “Local businesses and media agencies seeking to advertise in regional areas will continue to have a range of options in these local markets, including online and social media advertising with geo-targeting capabilities.” The ACCC also considered whether the proposed merger could lessen competition in markets for the supply of media content to consumers or for the acquisition of media content from producers. “The ACCC’s investigation found that Southern Cross and Seven are not close competitors for content. Southern Cross is primarily focused on radio and audio entertainment, while Seven is focused on print news and general TV,” Mr Keogh said. Also important in the ACCC’s decision was the impact of broader industry trends on competition, including the rise of streaming services and the significant growth of online advertising. “Australian media markets are being transformed by consumers’ growing preference for digital media,” Mr Keogh said. “This shift is leading advertisers to invest more heavily in online and digital channels.” “Owners of traditional media platforms such as radio, free-to-air television and newspapers will continue to face strong competition from digital media. Southern Cross will be no exception, even after the acquisition,” Mr Keogh said. “Ultimately, we found that the acquisition would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition in any market.” Further information can be found on the ACCC’s public register: Southern Cross Media Limited- Seven West Media Limited . Notes to editors In considering the proposed acquisition, the ACCC applies the legal test set out in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. In general terms, section 50 prohibits acquisitions that would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in any market. The “substantial lessening of competition” test focuses on the extent to which the merger parties constrain each other, and the effect of removing this competitive constraint on prices, quality or choice. It is not the same as a diversity (range of views) or plurality (number of voices) test and is not a public interest test. This acquisition is also subject to approval from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 which regulates the number of independent media ‘voices’ in a market. The ACMA’s ‘voices’ assessment considers the number of suppliers of commercial television and radio broadcasting services, and certain types of newspapers within particular geographic regions. The ACCC’s competition assessment is not restricted to particular media types and therefore can consider a broad range of outlets and advertising options, including streaming and online search. Questions about the ACMA’s voices requirements are best directed to the ACMA. The ACCC’s decision not to oppose this transaction under the Competition and Consumer Act is not an indication on how the ACMA will assess this transaction under the Broadcasting Services Act. Background On 30 September 2025, Southern Cross and Seven announced that they had entered into a Scheme Implementation Deed, pursuant to which Southern Cross agreed to acquire all issued shares in Seven by way of a scheme of arrangement. Under the proposed acquisition, Southern Cross shareholders will own 50.1% of the combined entity with Seven shareholders owning the remaining 49.9%. Southern Cross is an ASX-listed Australian media and entertainment company (ASX: SXL). It is the parent company of Southern Cross Austereo. Southern Cross operates 104 FM, AM and digital commercial radio stations through the Triple M and HIT brands and holds 88 radio licences in metropolitan areas and regional areas of Australia. Southern Cross also provides national sales representation to 56 regional radio stations through affiliation agreements with seven radio networks and a joint venture. In addition to broadcast radio, Southern Cross produces over 800 podcasts, 50 music stations and live sports coverage. Its digital audio services are available primarily on its LiSTNR platform. Seven is an ASX-listed Australian media and entertainment company (ASX: SWM). Seven owns and operates the free-to-air TV broadcaster the Seven Network, including its affiliate channels 7two, 7mate, 7flix 7Bravo, and Racing.com (among others).

    "ai_summary": "Here's a summary of the article, focusing on key information for compliance officers and business executives:\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has announced it will not oppose Southern Cross Media's (SXL) proposed acquisition of Seven West Media (SWM). The ACCC's decision is based on an assessment of competition across various markets, including advertising, content supply, and content acquisition, and taking into consideration the impact of broader industry trends.\nHere are the key takeaways:\n*   **No Substantial Lessening of Competition:** The ACCC concluded that the acquisition is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in any relevant market.\n*   **Limited Direct Competition:** Southern Cross and Seven are not considered close competitors in advertising opportunities, particularly in regional Western Australia, as they attract different advertisers.\n*   **Distinct Content Focus:** The ACCC found that the companies have distinct content focuses, with Southern Cross primarily focused on radio and audio, and Seven on print news and television.\n*   **Impact of Digital Media:** The ACCC recognized the increasing competition from streaming services and online advertising, which will continue to constrain the merged entity.\n*   **ACMA Review Still Pending:** While the ACCC has cleared the merger, it remains subject to approval from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, which considers media diversity and plurality.",

    "risk_rationale": "The ACCC's decision not to oppose the acquisition suggests a *Low* impact, as it primarily concerns the absence of a regulatory barrier rather than introducing new obligations. The ACCC \"found that the acquisition would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition in any market,\" indicating no significant disruption to market dynamics. While the ACMA's review under the Broadcasting Services Act is pending, this release focuses on competition law, suggesting the impact is limited to procedural aspects of the merger, such as ensuring compliance with existing regulations.

    "full_text": "Date 12 November 2025 Topics Competition and exemptions Soft Plastic Stewardship Australia (SPSA) and its industry members have been granted an eight-year authorisation by the ACCC allowing them to collect and recycle used soft plastic packaging under a voluntary scheme. The soft plastic collection and recycling scheme has been developed by food and grocery industry stakeholders, including Woolworths, Coles, ALDI, Nestlé, Mars and McCormick Foods, but will be run by SPSA. The scheme aims to increase the collection and recycling of soft plastic packaging from consumers, such as shopping bags and food wrappers. The ACCC was not involved in the design of the scheme and is not involved in its operations. SPSA and its industry members applied to the ACCC to have their collaboration in relation to this scheme be exempt from some of Australia’s competition laws. The ACCC may grant an exemption, called an ‘authorisation’, if it finds there is an overall public benefit. “As the scheme aims to acquire and broaden the current instore and kerbside trial collection programs for soft plastic recycling, we’ve determined that it will likely result in some soft plastics being diverted from landfill,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. “We consider this is an environmental benefit.” Industry participants will pay a fee based on how much soft plastic packaging they generate each year. “It is clear from the ACCC’s consultation process that many Australians want to recycle soft plastic packing and are concerned about its environmental impacts,” Mr Keogh said. “The recycling and collection options currently available to consumers are limited, and we consider that the SPSA scheme is an important way to expand those choices.” Broader issues of policy and regulations around soft plastics, including decisions about whether to introduce mandatory regulations, are beyond the scope of the ACCC’s role as the competition regulator and administrative decision-maker for the current application. “We don’t consider that the SPSA scheme will delay or deter other regulatory approaches to soft plastic stewardship,” Mr Keogh said. The ACCC’s exemption is subject to the following conditions: SPSA must complete annual public reporting about the performance of the scheme to ensure its transparency; The scheme must be independently reviewed in the third and seventh year of its operation and these reviews must consider recommendations for improvements to the scheme’s operations and governance; SPSA’s board must include at least two independent directors; and SPSA cannot enter into exclusive contracts with processors. More information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at Soft Plastic Stewardship Australia Limited . Note to editors The ACCC is not an environmental regulator and does not regulate the creation or use of soft plastic packaging, nor does it create or manage recycling schemes. The Australian Government, including the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water , is working to reform Australia’s packaging regulations to minimise packaging waste and pollution and build a circular economy for packaging. This reform is separate to this scheme. The ACCC’s role as Australia’s competition regulator includes assessing applications for competitors to work together, called ‘authorisations’. Broadly, the ACCC may grant an exemption when it is satisfied that the public benefit from the conduct outweighs any public detriment. Where ACCC authorisation is granted, it provides statutory protection from court action for certain conduct by competitors that might otherwise raise concerns under the Competition and Consumer Act. SPSA sought an exemption as some of the activities planned through the scheme involve competitors working together, which can sometimes risk breaching Australia’s competition laws. The authorisation and exemption role is limited to the exemption from specific sections of the Act, and, in this instance, authorisation is granted only in respect of Division 1 of Part IV and sections 45 and 47 of the Act. Background From 2011 to 2022, a return-to-store soft plastics collection program called ‘REDcycle’ partnered with major supermarkets to provide collection points for consumers to return used soft plastic packaging to stores for collection and recycling. REDcycle was funded by supermarkets and retail brands from several industries, including food and grocery, clothing and electronics, and at the time of its collapse, had approximately 192 participants in its program. After the collapse of the REDcycle program in 2022, the ACCC authorised ALDI, Coles and Woolworths to work together as part of the Soft Plastics Taskforce to pilot instore collections and process the stockpile of soft plastics that was left. The Taskforce was designed as a temporary arrangement to precede the development of a broader industry-wide stewardship program. The Soft Plastics Taskforce is chaired by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. The ACCC granted a further authorisation with conditions in February 2025 with respect to the Soft Plastics Taskforce and processing of the stockpile, which is due to expire on 31 July 2026. On 11 August 2025, the ACCC released a draft determination proposing to grant authorisation, with conditions, for eight years. The ACCC also granted interim authorisation allowing SPSA to: set (but not collect) the levy; arrange for services to operate the scheme (e.g. issue a request for information to processors); and share operational information with Coles, Woolworths, and ALDI, so SPSA can prepare to take over existing collections run by Soft Plastics Taskforce. Under this authorisation, SPSA intends to take over and expand the pilot instore collection program being run by the Soft Plastics Taskforce, as well as providing kerbside collections and potential drop off facilities.

    "full_text": "Speeches APRA Executive Director Carmen Beverley-Smith's remarks to the ASFA Conference 2025 Wednesday 12 November 2025 Print Email Building trust Superannuation in Australia, particularly, is built on a system of trust. Fund members entrust their retirement savings to the safekeeping of superannuation funds. They trust that their monies will be managed well and invested in their best interests. Even those most disengaged with their super, will have some level of confidence that their super is safe, their “nest egg” is growing and will be available to them in retirement. In our superannuation system, which has earned recognition on the world stage for its strength and success, that trust has been readily gained. But it should never be taken for granted. After a year marked by cyberattacks, multiple operational incidents and the high-profile collapse of two managed investment schemes offered through trustee-provided platforms, public trust and confidence in superannuation is certainly being put to the test. It is a recurring theme in the media, at industry events and in my own discussions with the Chairs, trustee board directors, CEOs and executives of funds that APRA regulates. As each new high-profile challenge emerges, the effectiveness with which funds manage the challenge, and support members through that challenge, attracts increasing public scrutiny and shapes community expectations. The events of this year serve as a reminder that trust is not static. Funds must continuously strive to maintain member confidence in their super as the stewards of it. My observation is that the best way to do this is by focusing on achieving three baseline capabilities: strong leadership, operational resilience and member-centricity. Strong Leadership The challenges and complexities of Australia’s $4.3 trillion super industry demand strong, courageous, accountable and transparent leadership. Leadership by all industry participants. Strong collaboration by industry bodies and leaders at the highest level of superannuation funds is essential to support cohesive and timely responses to external threats and strengthen member confidence. Effective leadership within fund themselves is also critical. I am often asked why I dedicate a large proportion of my time interacting with trustee directors and fund executives. While there is no prudential standard that articulates an overt obligation for trustees and fund executives to be “good leaders”, leaders set the tone, the direction, the expectations, the standards, the culture and ultimately determine the performance and success of their organisations. Leadership matters. Strong leadership is critical to having a well-run super fund and I am more than “interested” in that. It is also why APRA is specifically interested in the quality and capability of trustee boards. APRA is currently engaging with the industry to uplift board governance standards, not just in super but also across banking and insurance. The proposals, which were amended following the recent industry consultation, cover board member fitness and propriety, tenure and capabilities and skills, among other things. APRA expects to release draft governance standards and guidance in the second quarter of next year. While the governance review was not triggered by any superannuation-related issues, APRA has experienced concerns about how some boards have assessed fitness and propriety of directors in the not-so-distant past. Through our supervision work, we have also identified concerns regarding the strength of board oversight in areas core to superannuation, including investment governance. A recent APRA thematic review into unlisted asset valuations and liquidity risk governance found that, although asset valuation governance had improved since a previous review in 2021, 12 out of the 23 in-scope trustees required material improvement in either or both their valuation governance policies and practices or the design and operations of their liquidity risk management frameworks. APRA also observed cases of weaknesses in board oversight of asset valuations and conflicts of interest management. Just last month, APRA concluded a review of platform trustees and identified significant weaknesses in the practices of some trustees. The gaps are in areas such as due diligence and onboarding practices, ongoing monitoring of investment options, and remedial action where member outcomes are not being delivered. The in-scope trustees of that review are collectively responsible for 95 per cent of member assets held on platforms. APRA has required all trustees involved in that review to assess their practices, address weaknesses, and report any breaches of the prudential standards to us as a matter of urgency. In parallel, APRA has performed its own assessment of those trustees’ practices, who should expect to hear from us shortly. Where required, we will take appropriate supervisory or enforcement action to drive improvements and ensure member funds are being managed prudently. We expect this will be an ongoing, significant area of focus into 2026. Operational resilience Given the non-discretionary nature of superannuation contributions, Australians have an expectation that those who manage their superannuation savings are doing so well. Whether stated or implied, they rightly expect that funds have capable people, effective processes, sound data management practices and modern systems commensurate with their funds’ requirements. While some in this room might acknowledge that superannuation can be complex, many Australians believe it is “simple”.  And they expect the simple, done well: that is, their fund collects, grows and protects their retirement savings and then when they need it, that core services, such as rollovers and pension payments, are delivered without a hitch. Which brings me to the second baseline capability – operational resilience. As funds grow and the industry evolves and matures to become increasingly reliant on digital technology and third-party providers to deliver the services and experience members expect, the threat environment is heightened and the need for robust practices, processes and risk management increases significantly. The launch of APRA’s operational risk management standard CPS 230 in July, and the implementation of the Financial Accountability Regime for super, which also took effect this year, have clarified and emphasised the obligations and accountability of funds and their leaders for managing operational risks. APRA expects funds to understand intimately their key processes that deliver on commitments to members and to manage the risks and vulnerabilities in those processes and the data and systems that enable them – regardless of who physically performs those processes, be it in-house teams or contracted third parties. It may not always be possible to prevent things from going wrong, but we expect funds to be ready to respond quickly if they do, to minimise the impact on their members. APRA will continue to engage with entities to assess their adherence with the standard. The evolving and elevated cyber risk environment in which the superannuation industry operates is another area that requires ongoing and diligent oversight by senior leaders and a co-ordinated industry approach. Cyber resilience is a high priority focus for APRA, our peer regulators and government. Although the credential stuffing incidents which occurred earlier this year were relatively minor and contained, the occurrence exposed persistent weaknesses in access controls, specifically authentication across the industry. These incidents followed multiple warnings from APRA, including our clear message that multi-factor authentication is the bare minimum expectation in relation to cyber controls. After those attacks, APRA required all trustees to review their information security controls, including their authentication controls, and to submit breach notifications to APRA if any material control weaknesses were identified. We are in the final stages of assessing the responses from industry, including the more detailed actions required by the entities directly affected by the incidents. I would like to think I don’t need to say this, but APRA expect trustees to demonstrate that they meet their obligations under APRA’s Information Security standard CPS 234 on an ongoing basis. I also acknowledge that, given the pace at which the threat environment is evolving and maturing, what was required to meet those obligations a month ago might not be sufficient today. It is important to remember that CPS 234 articulates compliance obligations or minimum requirements. It by no means represents the level of information security governance that well managed funds should aspire to. Commitment to act in best financial interests of members The third baseline capability for building trust is acting consistently in the best financial interests of members. This is not an expectation as such; it is a legal obligation. One area where we’ve been concerned that some funds might not be meeting their best financial interests duty is in relation to expenditure decisions. A year ago, we intensified our scrutiny of how funds were spending members’ monies. That work has been supported by fund-level expenditure data that APRA now collects and publishes on an annual basis. We wanted to challenge spending by funds where the benefit to members was not immediately apparent or could not be reasonably justified. We have since sought information from 14 trustees, of varying scale and differing business models, and reviewed thousands of documents relating to discretionary expenditure including in relation to sponsorships, marketing, conferences, entertainment and related entity spending. Earlier this year we provided industry with an update on our fund expenditure work, including key observations and examples of better practice and areas for improvement, which we expect trustees have reviewed and compared against their own practices. We’ve also made it clear that where practices fall short of legal requirements, APRA will utilise the full range of its powers to hold a trustee accountable. Another way that super entities can demonstrate they are acting in the best interests of members is through their commitment to embrace their obligations under the Retirement Income Covenant. The covenant was introduced three years ago to ensure the industry had strategies to support the growing numbers of Australians transitioning to retirement, as well as those already in the retirement phase. It has put a much-needed emphasis on the retirement phase of superannuation, building upon the industry’s long-standing focus on and success in the accumulation phase. Despite the continued increase in members and sharp growth of assets in the retirement phase, the industry’s progress in implementing the covenant has been somewhat inconsistent. A thematic review conducted by APRA and ASIC one year after the covenant came into effect showed a lack of urgency the industry to meet their obligations. While we have seen progress and improvements since then, there is a clear and growing gap between trustees who are meeting baseline expectations and those who have embraced retirement as a strategic and competitive imperative. We will be able to share more insights into trustees’ progress in meeting their covenant obligations with the release of the results of the latest APRA and ASIC pulse check survey in two weeks’ time. But it is clear that, in many cases, trustees can and should be doing more to support their members in retirement. With another 2.5 million fund members expected to transition from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase this decade, trustees who are doing the bare minimum now may struggle to retain members when better retirement support and solutions are being offered elsewhere. Conclusion One definition of the word “trust” given by the Concise Oxford Dictionary is “confident expectation”. I think that neatly sums up the attitude that we would all want fund members to hold in relation to their superannuation. To have the confident expectation that their retirement savings will be collected, invested and protected during the accumulation phase, to provide a reliable, long-term source of retirement income in their later years. The events of this year have been a wake-up call that that while the expectation component of that definition is clear and a given, member confidence is not. As stewards of many Australians’ retirement savings for over three decades, trustees and fund executives must continue to earn the trust of their members each and every day. It is the obligation of everyone in this room and some not here today to play your part to ensure ongoing confidence in this extraordinary industry. Whatever your role: demonstrate strong and courageous leadership. Lead safe, strong and secure superannuation businesses with consistency for your members. And make that commitment to act, make every decision, in the best financial interests of the nearly 23 million superannuation fund members, whose financial futures you all collectively steward. While you are the custodians of trillions of dollars of retirement savings for the majority of people in this country, their trust is arguably the most important asset you will ever manage. Thank you. 2025 The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry. It oversees banks, mutuals, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, private health insurers, friendly societies, and most members of the superannuation industry. APRA currently supervises institutions holding around $9.8 trillion in assets for Australian depositors, policyholders and superannuation fund members.",

She highlighted recent challenges, including cyberattacks and collapses of managed investment schemes, that have tested public trust and outlined three baseline capabilities essential for building and maintaining trust: strong leadership, operational resilience, and member-centricity.\nHere are the key takeaways for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Elevated Governance Standards:** APRA is focused on uplifting board governance standards across the financial sector, including superannuation. Expect increased scrutiny on board member fitness and propriety, tenure, capabilities, skills, and oversight of critical areas like investment governance, asset valuations, and conflict-of-interest management. Draft governance standards and guidance are expected in the second quarter of next year.\n*   **Strengthened Operational Resilience:** Funds must understand and manage risks to key processes, data, and systems, whether managed internally or by third parties. APRA expects quick responses to incidents to minimize member impact. Cyber resilience remains a high priority, with ongoing reviews of information security controls, including authentication measures, against CPS 234.\n*   **Best Financial Interests Focus:** APRA is scrutinizing fund expenditure to ensure it demonstrably benefits members. They have been challenging spending where the benefit to members was not immediately apparent or could not be reasonably justified. Funds should expect continued scrutiny and potential enforcement action where practices fall short of legal requirements.\n*   **Retirement Income Covenant Implementation:** While some progress has been made, APRA sees inconsistent implementation of the Retirement Income Covenant across the industry. Trustees should proactively support members transitioning to retirement with better retirement support and solutions. Results of the latest APRA and ASIC pulse check survey will provide more insights.\n*   **Trust as a Core Asset:** Beverley-Smith emphasized that member trust is the most important asset that fund executives will ever manage.

    "full_text": "Date 11 November 2025 Topics Petrol and fuel Petrol prices are generally cheaper in cities that have more small-to-medium-sized independent petrol retailers competing with larger chains, the ACCC’s latest petrol industry report has found. The report looks at the market composition of Australia’s evolving petroleum industry. It found that among Australia’s capital cities, average retail prices for regular unleaded petrol were highest in Brisbane and Canberra from July 2022 to June 2024, where there are fewer independent petrol retailers in operation. In contrast, average retail petrol prices were generally lower in cities that had more smaller independent petrol retailers. “More competition leads to better outcomes for consumers including lower prices,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said. “Our report found that consumers can often find more competitive petrol prices in cities where there are a greater number of smaller independent petrol retailers.” “We encourage consumers to shop around and take advantage of near real-time petrol price apps and websites to find lower prices in their local area,” Ms Brakey said. The market share of smaller independent retailers is growing Smaller independent petrol retailers accounted for around 26 per cent of national retail petrol sales in 2023-24, increasing from 18 per cent in 2017-18. ‘Smaller independents’ represent a group of brands including Speedway, Metro Petroleum, Freedom Fuels, Budget, Vibe, Pearl Energy and others. In 2023-24, this collective group was made up of at least 30 different retail brands operating across Australia. In 2023-24, the larger retail brands accounted for around 74 per cent of national retail petrol sales. This included Ampol, bp, Chevron/Caltex, United Petroleum, 7-Eleven, EG Group, Coles/Reddy Express and On The Run. Some capital cities have more competing brands than others. Based on petrol sales in 2023-24, the ACCC estimates that as a group, smaller independents had the strongest presence in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, and a smaller presence in Brisbane and Canberra Estimated market shares of retail petrol sales for each capital city in 2023-24 Sources:   ACCC calculations based on data obtained from companies included in the ACCC’s petrol monitoring program, and ACCC estimates based on Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, Australian Petroleum Statistics 2025, and Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics, Road Vehicles, Australia, January 2024 , Table 5, both accessed on 17 October 2025. Notes:    In this chart, Shell branded sites supplied by Viva Energy are grouped with ‘smaller independents’. The ACCC understands that most Shell branded sites are independently operated. The market share for ‘smaller independents’ is estimated using the difference between the total of ACCC collected retail petrol sales volumes and the total volume of petrol sales reported in the Australian Petroleum Statistics. This difference broadly represents retail sales volumes by small to medium-sized retailers, and smaller independent retailers that the ACCC does not collect retail volume sales data from. Some percentages do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Four major companies refine, import and wholesale petrol in Australia Ampol, bp, ExxonMobil and Viva Energy supply (either through domestic refining or imports) and wholesale the majority of petrol around Australia. In 2023-24, these companies reported supplying in aggregate around 88 per cent of petrol, and accounted for around 85 per cent of total wholesale petrol sales in Australia. Australia’s domestic refining capacity has reduced significantly over a long period. Currently, Ampol and Viva Energy operate the two remaining refineries in Australia. “The industry has experienced some major changes over the last eight years. We have seen the decommissioning of significant refining infrastructure, a range of acquisitions, the renaming and rebranding of major companies, and changes to goods and services offered to consumers at retail fuel sites.” “Despite local refinery closures, the composition of major suppliers in the supply sector has remained relatively steady,” Ms Brakey said. National market shares of petrol volumes in the supply, wholesale and retail sectors in 2023-24 in percentage terms Source:  The aggregated market shares in this figure are based on ACCC calculations using data obtained from companies included in the ACCC’s petrol monitoring program, and certain retail data from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, Australian Petroleum Statistics 2025 , accessed on 17 October 2025. Notes:    The shares are based on petrol volumes refined or imported (for the supply sector) and volumes sold (wholesale and retail sectors). Supply and wholesale shares are based on total volumes for those companies from which the ACCC collects data. There are a small number of relatively smaller importers and wholesalers in the Australian petroleum industry that are not included in the ACCC’s data collection. Note to editors This report shows aggregate market shares based on total volumes across all grades of petrol. This includes: regular unleaded petrol 91, premium unleaded petrol 95 and 98, and E10 (regular unleaded petrol blended with up to 10% ethanol). The majority of registered vehicles in Australia are petrol-powered (around two-thirds), with most other registered vehicles powered by diesel. Background On 14 December 2022, the Treasurer issued a Direction to the ACCC to continue to monitor the prices, costs and profits relating to the supply of petroleum products in the petroleum industry in Australia and produce a report every quarter for a further three years. In addition to quarterly petrol monitoring reports, the ACCC also prepares petrol industry reports on particular aspects of consumer interest in the fuel market in relation to prices, costs and profits. As part of its monitoring activities, the ACCC currently collects volume and other data from the following companies: Ampol, bp, ExxonMobil, Viva Energy, Chevron, United Petroleum, 7-Eleven and EG Group, as well as data for the Coles Express/Reddy Express and On The Run retail networks (provided by Viva Energy).

Between 1 February 2012 and 20 November 2023, Mr Prior was the director of Cosmopolitan Double Bay Pty Ltd, Jaws Enterprises Pty Ltd and Angelo’s Restaurant Pty Ltd. At the time of ASIC’s decision, the three companies owed a combined total of $5,764,098 to unsecured creditors, including statutory debts to the AustralianTaxation Office, Workers Compensation Nominal Insurers as well as other trade creditors. ASIC found that Mr Prior acted improperly and failed to meet his obligations when he: failed to exercise due care and diligence to ensure that the companies met their statutory lodgement requirements, improperly used his position to cause detriment to the companies, and to gain an advantage for other companies, failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the companies maintained adequate financial records, and failed to ensure that the companies did not trade while insolvent. In disqualifying Mr Prior, ASIC relied on supplementary reports lodged by the liquidator of Cosmopolitan Double Bay Pty Ltd, Shumit Banerjee of the firm Westburn Advisory, and the liquidator of Jaws Enterprises Pty Ltd, Gess Rambaldi of the firm Pitcher Partners. ASIC assisted Mr Banerjee to prepare his report by providing funding from the Assetless Administration Fund. Mr Prior was also previously involved with Keystone Group Holdings Pty Limited and York Rooftop Pty Limited which failed between June 2016 and April 2017, owing $181,972,300.62 to unsecured creditors. Mr Prior is disqualified from managing corporations until 5 November 2030. Mr Prior has the right to seek a review of ASIC’s decision by the Administrative Review Tribunal. Background Section 206F of the Corporations Act allows ASIC to disqualify a person from managing corporations for a maximum period of five years if, within a seven year period, the person was an officer of two or more companies, and those companies were wound up and a liquidator provides a report to ASIC about each of the company’s inability to pay its debts.

ASIC alleges AVZ breached continuous disclosure obligations and engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by failing to announce an escalating legal dispute in the DRC relating to the acquisition of shares in AVZ’s flagship Manono Project to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). ASIC also alleges AVZ’s Managing Director Nigel Ferguson and Technical Director Graeme Johnston breached their director’s duties, authorised or permitted ASX announcements relating to AVZ that were false or misleading, or omitted matters that rendered them misleading. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘proper disclosures were critically important to investors, particularly when the company is operating an asset overseas. ‘In this case it was all but impossible for retail investors to travel to an overseas location in central Africa, in which the company’s operations are being conducted. In those circumstances, investors rely on the company to provide accurate and timely information. We allege Mr Ferguson and Mr Johnston failed to inform investors of the ongoing issues in this matter for nearly 12 months. ‘The pair allegedly failed to take reasonable steps to ensure AVZ complied with its continuous disclosure obligations and that statements to the ASX were not misleading or deceptive. ‘Continuous disclosure and director duties are not only legal obligations they are fundamental principles that protect the integrity of financial markets. ‘ASIC is committed to taking action against any entities we consider fail to meet these obligations, to ensure accountability and to maintain investor confidence,’ Ms Court said.

On 7 November 2025, the District Court of NSW sentenced Mr Agrawal to prison terms of: three years and three months for using false documents to obtain a financial advantage, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and three years and ten months for dishonestly using his position as a director with the intention to gain advantage and cause detriment, contrary to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Mr Agrawal’s prison term commenced on 7 November 2025. He will not be eligible for parole before 6 February 2029. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘Mr Agrawal betrayed the trust of people within his social and cultural circles. ‘This sentence will be welcomed by those who invested significant amounts of money with Mr Agrawal after being caught up in his dishonest behaviour’, the Deputy Chair said. Mr Agrawal is the current and former director of 27 companies collectively known as the Mansa Group, which is now in liquidation. Between 2017 and 2023, Mr Agrawal removed directors and shareholders of corporations within the Mansa Group, which he controlled, without their knowledge. He also applied for and obtained loans from third party lenders to the value of over $20 million dollars on that basis and/or with the use of false documents and used the loans for the benefit of other corporations which he controlled. This conviction follows previous action by ASIC to secure travel restraints against Mr Agrawal and his wife following the collapse of the Mansa Group ( 24-056MR ). This matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) ( CDPP ) following an ASIC investigation.

    "full_text": "Print Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email ASIC’s current review of Australia’s motor vehicle finance sector has exposed cracks in some lenders’ oversight of car finance distributors—revealing problematic sales tactics, and a lack of regular audits and checks by lenders. ASIC’s review follows a spike in complaints about motor vehicle finance to the regulator, as well as reports from consumer advocates about excessive establishment and interest costs as part of various car finance arrangements. Most lenders examined by ASIC rely on intermediaries, such as brokers and dealerships, to arrange motor vehicle finance, with ASIC uncovering significant variations in loan establishment costs. ‘We saw instances of loan establishment fees as high as $9,000 on a loan of $49,000,’ ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said. ‘We also found that almost half of all consumers who defaulted on their car finance repayments did so within the first six months of the loan. And of vehicles that were repossessed and sold, nearly 90% of consumers still owed more than half of their original loan amount. ‘These numbers raise questions about whether these consumers have been given loans they cannot afford to repay, which is consistent with key themes in complaints that led to this review.’ ASIC will continue its probe to understand why such considerable cost differences exist and separately why many customers cannot keep up with repayments in the first year of their loan term. The initial phase of this review examined every stage of a customer’s journey, from finance application, loan assessment and responsible lending checks to hardship requests, support, and dispute resolution. It highlighted the impact of unaffordable loans on customers and how this is resulting in poor consumer outcomes. In response, ASIC has issued tailored action letters to participating lenders based on our preliminary findings, with specific recommendations for each. The range of identified areas for improvement include: Better training, accreditation processes and oversight of lenders’ finance distribution channels Stronger product review triggers and risk frameworks using consumer harm indicators and available data, including internal and external dispute resolution data to ensure products reach the right target market Improved communication when financial hardship arrangements are in place (in line with ASIC’s recent hardship report ), including better information on voluntary surrender options Enhanced governance frameworks to ensure adequate oversight of intermediary brokers and dealers. Detailed findings from ASIC’s review will be released in 2026 and will include information on how lenders have responded to ASIC’s recommendations. Mr Kirkland said, ‘We’ve identified areas where lenders must lift their standards, or risk leaving consumers exposed to poor financial outcomes. ‘ASIC will take enforcement action to protect consumers where appropriate.’ ASIC currently has proceedings against car dealership Diamond Wheels, Keo Automotive and a former director for allegedly providing car loans to consumers while unlicensed, with many of those consumers having paid an excessive interest rate ( 24-209MR ). ASIC also took action against Money3 Loans following numerous complaints, including from consumer advocates, about the inappropriate provision of finance to vulnerable consumers. While the court recently ruled largely in Money3’s favour, some limited contraventions of the responsible lending provisions of the Credit Act were found ( 25-198MR ). Background This review takes a broad look at the motor vehicle finance sector, noting that misconduct in used car finance sold to vulnerable consumers remains a key enforcement priority for ASIC in 2025. The project aims to drive real change across industry, reducing consumer harm and improving outcomes for all car finance customers, including those in regional and remote areas and First Nations communities.

    "ai_summary": "ASIC is actively reviewing the motor vehicle finance sector in Australia due to a rise in consumer complaints and reports of problematic lending practices. The review has uncovered issues related to oversight of car finance distributors, high loan establishment fees, and a significant rate of early loan defaults. ASIC has issued tailored action letters to lenders with specific recommendations for improvement. Here are the key takeaways for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Enhanced Oversight and Control:** Lenders must improve training, accreditation, and ongoing oversight of their finance distribution channels (brokers and dealerships) to prevent problematic sales tactics and ensure responsible lending.\n*   **Strengthened Risk Management:** Lenders need to implement stronger product review triggers and risk frameworks, utilizing consumer harm indicators and internal/external dispute resolution data to ensure products are suitable for their target market.\n*   **Improved Communication and Support:** Lenders should enhance communication with customers experiencing financial hardship, providing clear information on available support options, including voluntary surrender.\n*   **Robust Governance:** Lenders are expected to establish enhanced governance frameworks to ensure adequate oversight of intermediary brokers and dealers.\n*   **Enforcement Action:** ASIC will take enforcement action where necessary to protect consumers from poor financial outcomes, particularly in cases of unlicensed lending or inappropriate finance provision to vulnerable consumers. ASIC will release detailed findings in 2026.",

    "full_text": "Date 10 November 2025 Topics Buying and selling products and services The ACCC will conduct a Black Friday sales sweep to identify misleading or deceptive sales advertising used by retailers. The sweep will focus on a range of sales advertising tactics used by retailers. This includes misleading limited time representations that create a false sense of urgency for consumers, misleading ‘site-wide’ or ‘store-wide’ claims about sales, and claims of ‘up to X% off’, where few products are on sale at X% off. “We are putting retailers on notice to review their sales advertising practices to ensure that any sales or discount claims they make are accurate, clear, and not likely to mislead or deceive consumers,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “Misleading advertising may influence a consumer’s behaviour and impact their ability to make an informed purchasing decision during the sales,” Ms Lowe said. “We will pay special attention to retailers who were identified as having problematic sales practices in the sweep we conducted during last year’s Black Friday and Boxing Day sales and expect to see improved compliance across the retail sector.” Retailers that use misleading or deceptive tactics during the Black Friday sales period may face enforcement action by the ACCC. “If consumers are waiting for the Black Friday sales to make a big purchase, we encourage them to consider checking the prices now before sales start, so they can compare the price and determine if they are making a legitimate saving,” Ms Lowe said. The ACCC encourages consumers to be wary of broad claims about discounts or savings during Black Friday and to check for any disclaimers or conditions in sales advertisements. “Consumers shopping during the Black Friday sales are encouraged to report promotions or ads that raise concerns to the ACCC, including images of the potential misconduct,” Ms Lowe said. The best way for consumers to report any potentially misleading or deceiving advertising representations is by the ACCC website , where images and specific detail can be provided. The ACCC has guidance that retailers should review on advertising and promotions. Consumer and fair-trading concerns in the supermarket and retail sectors, with a focus on misleading pricing practices, is a 2025-26 Compliance and Enforcement Priority for the ACCC. Background The ACCC sweep will focus on a range of conduct, including: Misleading time representations, including, the use of phrases such as ‘3 days only’ and devices such as countdown timers that don’t align with the true duration of the sale. Claims of store-wide or site-wide sales, when in fact the sales involve exclusions Fine print or disclaimers that seek to limit headline claims about the sale, including member-only deals or excluding a range of products. ‘Up to X% off’, where the ‘up to’ text is not prominently displayed, or where few or very few products are on sale at X% off. Misleading ‘was/now’ or ‘strikethrough’ pricing representations In 2024, the ACCC conducted a sweep of sales advertising by Australian retailers online and in store to target the Black Friday and Boxing Day sale periods. The 2024 sweep uncovered a range of concerning practices, including those listed above. Following the sweep, the ACCC launched a number of investigations into specific retailers and wrote to those retailers where the most concerning conduct was identified and asked them to justify their claims. In June 2025, Michael Hill, My House and Hairhouse online paid penalties for allegedly making false and misleading representations about their Black Friday Sales. There are still ongoing investigations as a result of the sweep conducted in 2024. Examples of the type of advertising that the upcoming sweep will focus on: Above: Example of the use of a countdown time which, if not accurate, can create a false sense of urgency. Above: Example of a retailer that advertises a ‘sitewide’ sale when in fact there are a range of products which are excluded from the sale. Above: Example of an ‘Up to’ X% off claim, where ‘up to’ text is easily missed by consumers.

    "full_text": "Date 6 November 2025 Topics Compliance and enforcement Problem with a product or service Stay protected Most furniture suppliers are failing to comply with new mandatory information rules that warn customers of the dangers of furniture tipping over, a sweep of businesses has revealed. The ACCC and state and territory consumer protection agencies examined over 3000 furniture products at more than 160 businesses. Of those businesses, 90 per cent were non-compliant with the mandatory toppling furniture information standard in relation to one or more of their products and more than half were non-compliant in relation to all products examined. Toppling furniture has killed at least 28 people in Australia since 2000 and causes nearly 20 injuries every week. The mandatory information standard, which came into effect on 4 May 2025, aims to reduce accidents and deaths due to furniture tipping over. It requires toppling furniture safety warnings to be provided to consumers online and in-store at point of sale, on products purchased by consumers, and in instructions that accompany products. “Unsecured furniture items like bookcases and cabinets can unexpectedly tip over causing severe injury or death,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said. “It can happen when a child climbs or pulls on open drawers or when an elderly person uses furniture for support.

It is critical that businesses include warnings and safety information on toppling furniture.” The sweep found 90 per cent of furniture suppliers had one or more products which failed to include mandatory warnings. About 52 per cent were fully non-compliant, meaning all toppling furniture products inspected had either no warning information displayed or had incorrect or incomplete information. Only 10 per cent of businesses were assessed as fully compliant with the mandatory information standard requirements. “The ACCC expects suppliers to take all reasonable steps to comply with the standard, to reduce the risk of death and injury associated with toppling furniture,” Ms Lowe said. “We will be continuing to monitor businesses to ensure they are displaying the mandatory safety warnings so that consumers have the information they need to stay safe. “We expect to see significant improvement in compliance and will consider enforcement action if this does not occur,” Ms Lowe said. The ACCC and state and territory consumer protection agencies have informed furniture suppliers who were assessed as non-compliant and requested rectification. Suppliers who fail to comply with the standard may face enforcement action including fines and penalties . Suppliers had a 12-month transition period from May 2024 to May 2025 to comply with the new information and labelling requirements. Information for suppliers Supplying a product that fails to comply with the information standard is a contravention of the Australian Consumer Law and may expose a business or individual to potential enforcement action by the ACCC. The maximum financial penalties for businesses are the greatest of: $50,000,000; three times the value of the \"reasonably attributable\" benefit obtained from the conduct, if the court can determine this; or if a court cannot determine the benefit, 30 per cent of adjusted turnover during the breach period. The maximum financial penalty for individuals is $2,500,000. The ACCC published supplier guidance to assist suppliers to comply with the mandatory standard. The information standard requires suppliers to: attach permanent safety warning labels to furniture, display safety warnings at the point of sale in-store and online, and provide safety information and warnings in instruction manuals. All suppliers in the supply chain, including retailers, wholesalers and distributers, are required to comply with the mandatory information standard. ACCC consumer guidance The ACCC published consumer guidance to inform consumers about the risks associated with toppling furniture, including how to pick safer furniture when shopping and how to properly anchor furniture to prevent tip over.

    "full_text": "Media Release Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision Number 2025-31 Date 4 November 2025 At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent. Inflation has recently picked up. Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. More recently, however, inflation has picked up. Trimmed mean inflation was 1.0 per cent in the September quarter and 3.0 per cent over the year, up from 2.7 per cent over the year in the June quarter. This was materially higher than expected at the time of the August Statement on Monetary Policy . Headline inflation rose sharply to 3.2 per cent over the year in the September quarter, a large part of which was expected given the cessation of electricity rebates in a number of states. The Board’s judgement is that some of the increase in underlying inflation in the September quarter was due to temporary factors. The central forecast in the November Statement on Monetary Policy , which is based on a technical assumption of one more rate cut in 2026, has underlying inflation rising above 3 per cent in coming quarters before settling at 2.6 per cent in 2027. Domestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain. Data on consumption suggest that the pick-up in private demand evident in the June quarter is ongoing. The housing market is continuing to strengthen, a sign that recent interest rate reductions are having an effect. Housing prices are rising and dwelling construction costs have also started to increase again after a period of weak growth. Credit is readily available to both households and businesses. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, notwithstanding a recent easing. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected and the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 per cent in September from 4.3 per cent in August. But measures of labour underutilisation remain at low rates, job vacancies are still at a high level and business surveys and liaison continue to suggest that a significant share of firms are experiencing difficulty sourcing labour. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but productivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both domestic and international developments. On the domestic side, if the pick-up in private demand continues to exceed expectations, this could increase the demand for labour, add to capacity pressures and make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases. Alternatively, the improvement in private demand might not persist. Uncertainty in the global economy remains elevated but so far there has been minimal impact on overall growth and trade, and many forecasters have revised up their near-term expectations for world growth. Trade policy developments are still expected to have an adverse effect on world growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat to the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions in the domestic economy. There are also uncertainties regarding the assessment that monetary policy remains a little restrictive, the lags in the effect of recent monetary easing, the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and the outlook for productivity growth. These uncertainties present risks in both directions to the inflation and employment outlook. Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority. The recent data on inflation suggest that some inflationary pressure may remain in the economy. With private demand recovering and labour market conditions still appearing a little tight, the Board decided that it was appropriate to maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the beginning of the year, but it will take some time to see the full effects of earlier cash rate reductions. Given this, and the recent evidence of more persistent inflation, the Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of uncertainty about the outlook in both directions. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Decision Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

    "full_text": "Speeches APRA Member Suzanne Smith - Speech to Financial Services and ASX Sector Assurance Forum 2025 Tuesday 28 October 2025 Print Email A time-tested approach for a new world of technological risks Key points “Technology has become ever more integrated into the business models of APRA-regulated entities, whether it be “tap and go” payments, super members accessing their balances on their phones or insurers using drones to assess property damage in the aftermath of a bushfire or flood. Today’s banks, insurers and super funds aren’t simply financial services providers; they have effectively become technology companies, responsible for developing, integrating and maintaining vast systems of enormous capability and complexity and storing reams of sensitive data.” “Many of the banks, insurers and superannuation trustees APRA supervises rely heavily on legacy systems, which are often built on now outdated software and hardware. These systems are typically less resilient to cyber threats as they often fall short of modern requirements for encryption, segregation, user access, authentication, and real-time monitoring.” “One of the key responsibilities internal audit has is making sure the fundamentals are in place, particularly with respect to workforce planning, employee engagement and the delivery of digital transformation initiatives. Internal audit should also be alert to cost-cutting and cost optimisation strategies designed to maintain profitability that inadvertently become very expensive. Delaying the replacement of technology assets, for example, often comes with hidden costs which eventually need to be paid.” “One concern APRA is playing close attention to is concentration risk. Across banking, insurance and superannuation, critical operation delivery often hinges on a concentrated set of technology vendors in areas such as the cloud, processors, network, software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). That means if one of these technology providers fails, even temporarily, they can potentially take down services at every company relying on their services.” “Risks may evolve as technology changes, but the broad principles of good risk management remain the same. As auditors and other compliance professionals, your job is to identify the areas of highest risk within your organisations, conduct reviews to ensure these risks are being mitigated, and speak up when they are not.” Good morning. I’m very pleased to be here at this event for the first time. Australia’s financial services industry, as we recognise it today, was arguably born on the 8th of April 1817 in a house rented from an ex-convict in Macquarie Place – just 500 metres from where we are now. The newly created Bank of New South Wales printed notes with the same press used to publish the colony’s daily newspaper. A bank note issued on that first day of business, now owned by the Australian Museum, is hand numbered and personally signed by both the cashier and the president of the bank. It’s made out for a sum of “10 shillings sterling.” 1 Our first bank had no electricity or telephones. The only webs were in the rafters and the only thing stored in clouds was rain – itself a valuable commodity in a colony still dependent on the heavily polluted Tank Stream for fresh water. Yet it made a valuable contribution to economic development in a settlement where rum, barter and “IOUs” had been the predominant currencies for much of its brief history to that point. In contrast, today’s financial services companies possess a level of technological sophistication that was barely imaginable a few decades ago, let alone in the early 19th century. A news article in the Financial Review from 1996, for example, describes Australians taking to telephone banking “like a duck to water” but warns there are doubts they will do the same with internet banking! 2 In the years since, technology has become ever more integrated into the business models of APRA-regulated entities, whether it be “tap and go” payments, super members accessing their balances on their phones or insurers using drones to assess property damage in the aftermath of a bushfire or flood. Today’s banks, insurers and super funds aren’t simply financial services providers; they have effectively become technology companies, responsible for developing, integrating and maintaining vast systems of enormous capability and complexity and storing reams of sensitive data. The innovations now available to these institutions and their customers have delivered amazing benefits in terms of efficiency and convenience. But they have also brought significant risks that need to be managed in areas such as cyber risk, operational risk and data risk. Amplifying the challenges is the speed of modern technological change as each innovation makes others possible in turn. The dawn of the artificial intelligence age promises to turbo-charge that process further, amid predictions our economy – perhaps even society – may be drastically altered in coming years by super-intelligent AI. While technology may assist internal auditors and other risk professionals to do their jobs, the basic principles of good risk management haven’t changed. As a company’s third line of risk management defences, it’s vital that internal auditors continue to probe, ask questions and speak up with an “outside-in” perspective. Just as importantly, boards and senior managers need to heed that voice and take action when material gaps in controls are identified. Cybersecurity When I mention technology-related risks associated, I suspect many of you immediately think of cyber security. In APRA’s most recent stakeholder survey, it was nominated as the number one concern with 91 per cent of banks, insurers and super funds describing it as a critical or high risk. The ongoing rise in digital banking, online superannuation management and digital insurance platforms has led to an expanded attack surface for those with malign intent. Our financial institutions are relentlessly targeted by sophisticated cybercriminals, employing tactics including ransomware, AI-enhanced malicious activities, phishing and supply chain attacks. While the vast majority of these attacks are repelled, it only takes one successful breach to threaten customer data and money and the financial and operational resilience of entire institutions and market stability. Six years after APRA’s first prudential standard on information security, CPS 234, took effect, all APRA-regulated entities take cyber security with the seriousness you’d expect. However, looking across the financial system, the level of cyber resilience remains uneven and persistent gaps remain. A program of tripartite assessments of compliance with CPS 234, which wrapped up last year, revealed sector wide deficiencies. These included incomplete identification and classification of information assets, inadequate authentication controls, sporadic third-party security assurance, irregular and inconsistent testing, and incident response plans not regularly tested with exercises. Since completing the exercise, we’ve been working with entities to close these gaps. While progress is being made, much more uplift is required, as evidenced by the credential stuffing attacks on superannuation funds mid-year. The cyber resilience journey is never done and must continue to evolve to match the increasing sophistication of the threats. We’ve made clear that cyber needs to be treated by the board as a whole-of-business risk, and not just at IT issue, and internal audit has a vital role here. Pointed lines of inquiry include: Has authentication strength matched the increasing threats? Are basic cyber hygiene protocols being followed? Has adequate third-party assurance been undertaken? Is testing sufficient in terms of frequency, coverage and technique? Has incident detection been exercised and has response maturity been tested; and Are detailed CPS 234 incident notifications being lodged promptly? This last point is one I want to stress. APRA-regulated entities are required to notify us in a timely manner, even if the organisation does not have perfect information about the incident. These notices are an important means of ensuring APRA has a clear view of cyber issues at both an entity and system-level. Some incident patterns we’ve observed through these notifications are: accidental data disclosure, such as sensitive customer reports being distributed to the wrong recipient. This highlights weak data handling procedures, inadequate data leakage limits and lack of compensating controls while at the same time as putting vulnerable persons at risk of harm, particularly where domestic violence is involved; credential compromise and a lack of strong authentication. This is enabling credential stuffing and spraying type of attacks to be more effective than they should be, testing entities’ detection and response maturity; insufficient network monitoring and management capabilities. This allows malicious network activity to either remain undetected for an excessive amount of time or limits capabilities to adjust to malicious activity in a manner which allows continued customer service; and service provider incidents. These include exposures in service providers spilling into regulated entities, underscoring third party assurance gaps as well as the effectiveness of techniques to limit contagion. These are not edge cases, they are repeatable patterns that call for broad visible controls, disciplined testing, and timely APRA notifications. A difficult legacy While the explosion in digital financial technologies has opened up new opportunities for cyber adversaries to exploit, old technologies bring their own set of vulnerabilities. Many of the banks, insurers and superannuation trustees APRA supervises rely heavily on legacy systems, which are often built on now outdated software and hardware. These systems are typically less resilient to cyber threats as they often fall short of modern requirements for encryption, segregation, user access, authentication, and real-time monitoring. Entities frequently face difficulties sourcing components or skilled professionals to maintain these systems, which increases the risk of outages that may impede their ability to meet obligations to customers. They also face challenges in integrating legacy systems with modern digital channels, affecting the agility of business models and their long-term competitiveness. With modern financial service consumers demanding fast, seamless transactions available at any hour of the day, including the latest mobile apps, online services and other digital tools, almost every entity I visit is undertaking some sort of technological transformation. These transformation programs are typically expensive, complex, and fraught with logistical, financial, and even ethical challenges. To help avoid these transformations going awry, APRA expects entities to invest appropriately in technology management capability, budgeted technology roadmaps, staff training and communication to minimise risks as they transition legacy systems to more modern platforms. One of the key responsibilities internal audit has is making sure the fundamentals are in place, particularly with respect to workforce planning, employee engagement and the delivery of digital transformation initiatives. Internal audit should also be alert to cost-cutting and cost optimisation strategies designed to maintain profitability that inadvertently become very expensive. Delaying the replacement of technology assets, for example, often comes with hidden costs which eventually need to be paid. One company that paid highly was America’s Southwest Airlines, which suffered a meltdown of its flight scheduling system in December 2022 that left more than two million travellers stranded over 10 days. Unions pointed to years of underinvestment in IT, leaving the airline reliant on “antiquated” technology that became completely overwhelmed at one of the busiest times of the year. In addition to paying out more than $US600 million on refunds and reimbursements, Southwest was fined $US140 million by Federal authorities, plus lost revenue and additional labour costs. 3 Internal audit can and should provide clarity on the potential hidden costs of holding onto legacy systems so they are not overlooked in the hunt for short term savings. As companies undertake their modernisation journeys, operational readiness, including staff capability and robust testing, is central to maintaining service standards and managing customer impacts. APRA has observed that the accelerated adoption of technologies such as software as a service, AI, machine learning or blockchain, can sometimes outpace internal skills and governance frameworks. This can lead to ineffective implementations and increased risk exposure, as well as negative outcomes for customers and employees. Internal audit can play a role here by ensuring thorough risk assessments are conducted for all digital initiatives; and that risks and controls are documented and implemented, incorporated into project planning, tested, and updated when there are changes to the project scope and execution. Clouds and crowds As the costs and complexity of developing and maintaining the modern technological infrastructure needed in financial services grow, companies are becoming more dependent on third-party service providers. This increased use of service providers carries its own risks, which APRA has spoken about extensively in relation to our new prudential standard, CPS 230 Operational Risk Management. In particular, lack of transparency and control over crucial operations can create significant financial and operational threats if not adequately managed. For example, dependency on the cloud and movement of workloads to the cloud environment has exponentially increased third-party and concentration risk, data security and privacy concerns. Consequently, CPS 230 requires entities to have a comprehensive understanding of their supply chain vulnerabilities and develop contingency plans to mitigate potential disruptions. This includes strong contract management, conducting thorough risk assessments, establishing strong partnerships with key suppliers and implementing robust monitoring mechanisms to ensure continuity of operations. One concern APRA is playing close attention to is concentration risk. Across banking, insurance and superannuation, critical operation delivery often hinges on a concentrated set of technology vendors in areas such as the cloud, processors, network, software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). That means if one of these technology providers fails, even temporarily, they can potentially take down services at every company relying on their services. The best-known example of this from recent history was last July’s Crowdstrike outage which disabled 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices worldwide, taking down critical systems at airports, banks, hospitals and supermarkets. 4 To better understand this risk, APRA asked all its regulated entities to submit a list of their material service providers by the beginning of this month. We have now begun analysing the data to develop a financial system-wide view of entities’ reliance on third party service providers and where particular concentration risks may lie. As finance, telecommunications, emerging technologies, and platforms increasingly converge, APRA will continue to engage with Government and regulatory peers as the Critical Infrastructure reforms evolve further. Our focus will remain on shaping sector-wide incident playbooks; improving information sharing; and participating in exercises that test industry coordination with government regulatory agencies including the Council of Financial Regulators. Entities should be undertaking their own work independently to address third-party and concentration risk. This includes undertaking service interdependency mapping and credible scenario testing involving both complete failures and “degraded-mode” operations. These need to be routine and broadly-visible – not “once and done”. Auditors should look for scenario design that includes multi-entity, multi vendor failures, and for clear customer outcome metrics when operating in contingency modes. Your checks need to go beyond checking documents to properly validating whether tolerance levels, mapping, and testing, truly capture real points of failure across first, second, third, and further, parties. Data surge Widespread use of cloud storage across APRA-regulated industries is closely related to another rising technology-related challenge – data risk. This isn’t a new risk, but it’s one that is growing if for no other reason than the volume of data that companies generate each year keeps expanding. The proliferation of customer data across digital channels amplifies privacy, consent, and data management issues. We find many organisations struggle to guide data management, maintain consistent data quality, ensure traceability of data, understand and leverage metadata, and comply with evolving privacy regulations and international regulations. APRA expects our regulated entities to stay on top of this challenge by implementing comprehensive data governance policies, including data mapping, quality controls, robust authorisation and access control, desensitisation of data wherever possible, and regular audits. We also encourage the adoption of privacy-by-design principles and robust data breach response plans. Upping both the stakes and volume of data is rapid expansion in the use of AI, with one forecast estimating demand for AI-ready data centre capacity will rise at an average rate of 33 percent a year between 2023 and 2030. 5 If companies thought they had enough data to manage with seemingly endless internal emails, imagine when most emails are composed with the help of AI! Our preparedness for AI use and deployment must consider new risks and the broadening of current risk, especially in the areas of data. The economics of data aggregation could lead to growing concentration risk, with single-source providers of data and foundational AI models driving greater homogeneity and potentially biased data sets in the financial sector. AI is an emerging area for internal audit to examine and also represents a wholesale change in how auditors engage, assess risk, reach sufficient depth in their work, and address the complexity of providing an AI audit assurance opinion. Indeed, many of you are still trying to determine: \"How far do we go to render an opinion?\" For example, do you need to \"check the math?\" Will auditors need to understand and master increasingly technical capabilities to appropriately conduct work in AI? The answers to these questions are still evolving, however a starting point can be found in proven international frameworks for assessing and auditing emerging technologies. These can assist in ensuring that innovation is balanced with prudent risk controls and robust governance structures. More specifically, auditors can help companies manage data and AI risks by: assessing the monitoring and oversight for AI-generated outputs; assessing data classification for these outputs; reviewing controls for their retention and deletion; and evaluating data localisation and sovereignty compliance programs. First principles APRA is often asked whether we intend to regulate the use of AI by our regulated entities. We have stepped up our monitoring of the emerging AI risks by reviewing practices across some larger institutions, including the appropriateness of risk management and oversight. Before the end of the year, we will undertake targeted supervisory engagements with a group of larger financial institutions to get a better understanding of leading industry practices and common challenges relating to AI. Beyond technical considerations, we are encouraging our regulated entities to think strategically about AI ethics and governance, particularly as generative AI removes traditional human guardrails from decision-making processes. This will require them to embed strong ethical frameworks and accountability mechanisms into their AI governance structures, ensuring human oversight remains meaningful even when automated systems operate with greater autonomy.” However, we remain of the view that our existing regulatory framework is sufficient to capture the use of AI by banks, insurers and super funds. These include our prudential standards and guidance on information security, operational risk management, data risk and general risk management. And this brings me to my most fundamental message today: risks may evolve as technology changes, but the broad principles of good risk management remain the same. As auditors and other compliance professionals, your job is to identify the areas of highest risk within your organisations, conduct reviews to ensure these risks are being mitigated, and speak up when they are not. That doesn’t mean auditors can safely ignore technological developments. Auditors must have a solid understanding of how new technologies work and what they mean to the organisation, so they can provide assurance to boards that risks in areas such as cybersecurity, data governance, system implementation, system recovery, and migration are mitigated. APRA expects internal audit to deliver independent, risk‑based assurance over an entity’s information‑security capability and control environment, proportionate to the threat landscape and the criticality of business services. When required, that means stepping in to directly test where no other effective mechanisms exist. In practice, this includes assessing whether the CPS 234 control‑testing program is well‑designed and operating effectively; and verifying the organisation’s ability to detect, respond and recover through plans and exercises. Given CPS 230’s emphasis on operational resilience and material service providers, internal audit should also evaluate outsourced arrangements end‑to‑end. Reporting should triangulate Line One and Two results, supplier attestations, and independent reviews, and provide clear opinions to the Board and Audit Committee on residual risk and whether governance and controls, for both the organisation and the service provider, meet prudential expectations. Back to basics Australia’s financial services industry has come a long way since that first bank opened back in 1817. In those days, transferring money from London to Sydney required a sea journey of up to four months. 6 Today, it happens almost instantaneously via digital transfer. Technological innovation has markedly upped the convenience available to companies and their customers – and eliminated the threat, at least in banking, of shipwrecks and pirates – but other dangers have emerged: cyber criminals, network outages, crashed servers, human error, and data breaches. While the tools available to our financial forebears were rudimentary – quill pens, printing presses, cast iron safes and oil lamps – they were simple to understand and repair when things went wrong. The same can’t be said about many of the increasingly sophisticated, algorithmic-based technologies used by modern financial institutions. Not only are these technologies typically opaque, even for IT and cyber professionals, but they frequently rely on a range of interconnected third parties. With outdated legacy systems raising the risk of malfunctions and cyber breaches, most APRA-regulated entities are embracing new technologies to remain competitive and meet customer demands around service and efficiency. As they do so, internal audit has a crucial role to play in ensuring governance, control frameworks, and risk management keep pace with these changes. Because while technology is ever-changing, getting the basics right, and the principles of good risk management, are largely timeless.

    "ai_summary": "This speech by APRA Member Suzanne Smith to the Financial Services and ASX Sector Assurance Forum 2025 highlights the critical importance of technology risk management in the modern financial services industry. She emphasizes that financial institutions are increasingly reliant on complex technological systems, making them effectively technology companies, and therefore must prioritize robust risk management practices. Key areas of focus include cybersecurity, legacy systems, digital transformation, and third-party dependencies.\nHere are the key takeaways for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Cybersecurity Gaps Persist:** Despite increased awareness, significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities remain across the financial system. Key areas of concern include incomplete asset identification, inadequate authentication controls, sporadic third-party security assurance, inconsistent testing, and insufficient incident response preparedness. APRA expects prompt notification of cyber incidents, even with incomplete information.\n*   **Legacy Systems Pose Risks:** Reliance on outdated software and hardware creates vulnerabilities due to weaker security controls and difficulties in integration with modern systems. Underinvestment in IT infrastructure and delayed upgrades can lead to significant operational disruptions and financial losses. Internal audit should highlight the hidden costs of maintaining legacy systems.\n*   **Third-Party Concentration Risk:** The growing dependence on a concentrated set of technology vendors (cloud, SaaS, etc.) introduces significant concentration risk. A failure at one of these providers could disrupt services across multiple institutions. CPS 230 requires comprehensive understanding of supply chain vulnerabilities and robust contingency plans.\n*   **Digital Transformation Requires Vigilance:** Accelerated adoption of new technologies (SaaS, AI, blockchain) can outpace internal skills and governance frameworks, leading to ineffective implementations and increased risk.

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA revises governance proposals following industry consultation Friday 24 October 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has provided an update on its consultation to modernise the prudential framework on governance for banks, insurers and superannuation trustees. In March, APRA proposed eight measures to update its cross-industry prudential standards and guidance on governance for the first time in more than a decade. During the three-month consultation period, APRA held 57 meetings and roundtables involving over 150 stakeholder organisations and received almost 80 written submissions. Through these engagements, APRA received broad support for the package overall, especially for initiatives that can reduce burden and address regulatory overlap. But APRA also heard caution around the potential impact of some proposals. Having carefully considered this feedback, APRA has today written to industry advising it will modify three of its original proposals to ensure they don’t impose undue regulatory constraint on boards: Instead of a tenure limit for non-executive directors of 10 years with the possibility of a two-year extension, APRA now proposes a hard tenure limit of 12 years with short extensions in limited circumstances. A proposal for banks and insurers to have at least two independent directors (including the chair) not on other group boards will not proceed as originally proposed. A proposal to require significant financial institutions to engage early with APRA on responsible person appointments and succession planning will also not proceed. APRA will also clarify or adjust proposals relating to individual director skills, perceived conflicts of interest, and publication of registers of relevant interests and duties. Chair John Lonsdale said APRA remains committed to uplifting standards of governance in banking, insurance and superannuation. “Effective governance is fundamental to financial stability and sound risk management. Across our regulated industries, APRA continues to see cases where deficient governance leads to poor prudential outcomes. “However, in strengthening standards of governance, we want to strike a balance between increased prescription in some areas and making sure we retain sufficient flexibility for different business models. “We have benefited from the range of feedback from consultation, and today’s update demonstrates that we have listened carefully to the views of stakeholders. These changes will still deliver the uplift in governance standards APRA is seeking but we have found an outcome that works better for all parties. “APRA will continue to engage with industry as we work towards releasing updated prudential standards and guidance for further consultation in the first half of next year.” Today’s letter is available on the APRA website at: Governance review update .

    "full_text": "Media Releases APRA proposes more accessible pathway to IRB accreditation for banks Thursday 23 October 2025 Print Email The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has proposed a simpler, clearer and more streamlined pathway for banks to become accredited to use the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to calculating credit risk-weighted assets. The IRB method is one of two approaches banks can use to calculate risk-weighted assets, which determines the amount of regulatory capital they need to hold for credit risk. 1 While the vast majority of banks use the standardised approach, APRA has approved six of the largest banks to use the IRB approach. 2 The IRB approach can provide a small financial benefit to banks by marginally reducing their capital requirements. However, accreditation to use the IRB approach requires banks to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in their risk management practices that has historically been too resource-intensive for most banks to achieve. Noting that some medium-sized banks have expressed interest in obtaining IRB accreditation, APRA is seeking to make the pathway to IRB accreditation more accessible for these banks. This was one of the commitments APRA made as part of the recent Council of Financial Regulators’ and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Review into Small and Medium-sized Banks . In a consultation paper released today, APRA has proposed a range of changes to the IRB accreditation pathway designed to help more banks access the IRB approach. APRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said the proposed changes are further evidence of APRA’s commitment to “getting the balance right” in its regulatory settings. “Capital is the cornerstone of every bank’s financial resilience so it’s essential banks can accurately align their capital requirements with the risks they face. “For most banks, the simpler and more conservative standardised approach to calculating risk weighted assets is the most cost-effective way for them to do this. But we recognise that a cohort of mid-sized banks have told us that gaining IRB accreditation would help them compete more effectively with the largest banks, especially for home loans. “While we don’t intend to drop our standards, the changes we are proposing today would improve the flexibility and transparency of the accreditation process, thereby supporting banks to more confidently plan, invest and transition, should they wish to,” Ms McCarthy Hockey said. A consultation paper outlining the proposed changes is available here: A new pathway to internal ratings-based accreditation . Footnotes 1 More information on the two approaches to calculating risk-weighted assets is available here: APRA Explains: Risk-weighted assets | APRA 2 Banks accredited to use the IRB approach are the four major banks, Macquarie Bank and ING Bank Australia.

    "full_text": "Speeches Deputy Chair Margaret Cole - Remarks to the FSC Innovation in Retirement conference Thursday 16 October 2025 Print Email It’s a pleasure to be here and to have this opportunity to discuss APRA’s priorities for superannuation as the industry transitions to the retirement phase. This is one of my first public speaking engagements since the announcement of my decision to leave APRA by the end of my term in June next year. It has been, and continues to be, a privilege to oversee the industry at such a critical stage of its history. The superannuation industry is in a state of change driven by three powerful forces. The first, and the basis of many discussions at this forum today, is the ageing of the population and the implications that has for trustees and their members. Treasury has previously estimated that around 2.5 million Australians will transition from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase in this decade. How trustees respond to the challenge of supporting a sharply higher number of members in retirement will be a true test of the system. The second is the continued strong growth in superannuation assets. The system now has $4.3 trillion in assets, of which $3 trillion are held in APRA-regulated funds. That makes it the fourth largest pension system in the world behind that of the US, Canada and the UK, and, by some estimates, is on track to become the second largest by 2040. The expanding asset pool adds complexity for trustees in how they manage, invest, spend and safeguard their members’ monies. The third force is superannuation’s increasing significance to the broader financial system. The potential risks to financial stability arising from the increased interconnectedness of banking and superannuation are important to understand. We expect to publish the early findings from APRA’s inaugural system stress test, which evaluated those risks, later this year. When you factor in geopolitical instability, the rise in cyberattacks and fraud, as well as the growth in artificial intelligence, trustees have an extremely complex and fast-evolving operating environment to navigate. Before I delve into the detail of APRA’s priorities for super, it’s worth reflecting: where did this large complex system, which has become so important to the financial wellbeing of Australians in retirement, first begin? The introduction of the superannuation guarantee in 1992 was critical to the creation and rapid expansion of the universal compulsory superannuation system that we have today. However, the first employer-funded pension scheme came into being a full century and a half earlier. In 1842 the local directors of the fledging Australasian Bank wanted to find a way to retain their bank officers. So, they came up with the idea – and their UK-based proprietors agreed – to launch a bank-funded pension scheme. The scheme was formally approved at an annual meeting held in London in June of that year, with the first report of the meeting hitting the headlines of the Sydney Morning Herald 1 some four months later, such being the pace of international news at the time. To quote from the Herald article dated 8th of October 1842: “It appeared to the directors that the most effectual way of retaining the services of their officers would be to create a fund out of which pensions should be granted to those who, from age or length of meritorious service, or physical incapacity, might establish a claim to such a provision.” But it is what follows that I found of particular interest. The meeting report goes on to say – and, again, I quote: “It will be some years before a claim can arise to form a charge on this fund, and when that period approaches the directors will be prepared with a digested plan for its application.” In case of doubt let me assure you such a “we’ll worry about it later” approach would not hold much water with APRA today. Nor would it align with the spirit of the Retirement Income Covenant, which is central to one of APRA’s core strategic objectives: improved outcomes for superannuation members. The Retirement Income Covenant – a case for urgency The introduction of the Retirement Income Covenant more than three years ago represented a major nudge for the super industry. While the accumulation phase of superannuation continued to require trustees’ strong focus, it was critical that the industry should pay greater attention to supporting the needs of members in or approaching retirement. A core obligation under the covenant is for trustees to develop and implement retirement income strategies. But a year after the covenant came into effect, an APRA and ASIC joint thematic review identified a lack of urgency by trustees to meet their obligations. While we have seen progress and improvements since then, there is a clear and growing gap between trustees who are meeting baseline expectations and those who have embraced retirement as a strategic and competitive imperative. The case for having robust retirement income strategies is pressing. Our data shows that one in five funds have more than half of their members in or approaching retirement. However, over the next 20 years, this is expected to rise to around two in five funds. The initial thematic review was followed by an APRA-ASIC pulse check survey last year, which explored the progress trustees were making to implement the recommendations arising from the review. Yet again, we were concerned to find a lack of progress, this time in the tracking and measuring the success of retirement income strategies, despite this being a core recommendation. Our latest joint pulse check was conducted earlier this year. How much progress has been made, and where there is still room for improvement, will be outlined in the survey findings, due for release next month. Meeting members needs Understanding the needs of members, and tailoring support to help them balance the objectives of maximising income, managing risks, and flexible access, lies at the heart of the covenant. This includes providing access to quality information to support member decision-making at the point of retirement. While some funds are doing a good job at this, we believe there are still many members who could benefit from greater access to easy-to-understand information about the products, services and choices available to them. Our data suggests that large numbers of retirement-age members remain in accumulation phase products paying tax where, depending on their personal circumstances, they are likely to be better off in the tax-free retirement phase. For example, $99 billion of assets in MySuper accounts are held in the accounts of members aged 65 or over. In terms of products, APRA is doing its part to support greater product innovation in meeting the specific and various needs of members. APRA recently consulted with the life insurance industry on proposals to reduce capital requirements for insurers offering annuity products. APRA’s aim is to lower the cost to life insurers of providing annuity products, helping to attract participants and support growth in the market, so that more members can consider this type of product where suitable for their individual circumstances. APRA will commence a second consultation on these reforms shortly and aims to finalise the proposed changes in the first half of next year. The bigger picture The oncoming wave of members entering retirement will bring a substantial increase in assets in the retirement phase of super. Our latest estimates are that assets in retirement products will swell from $575 billion to around $3 trillion in 20 years’ time. Trustees will need to be prepared to manage the significant risk that this represents: Cyber risk, operational risk, investment risk, liquidity risk immediately spring to mind. The credential stuffing cyberattacks that targeted individual superannuation members at several different funds earlier year were contained. But their occurrence exposed persistent weaknesses in authentication practices across the industry. They also indicated that the super system was in the sights of threat actors. Unlike members in the accumulation phase, those in retirement can access their super savings which increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks, scams and fraud. A continuing priority for APRA is to ensure that regulated entities have robust information controls in place, including – but not limited to - multi factor authentication for member accounts. For me, the urgency for planning and action on cyber protections was further emphasised this week by the Australian Signals Directorate. As reported in the media, the directorate has warned that developments in quantum computing could break the encryption used to protect passwords within five years. It’s a sobering thought. Given the growing reliance on third parties, rapid technological advancements and geopolitical uncertainty, effective implementation of APRA’s operational risk management standard CPS 230 – particularly those requirements relating to oversight of material service providers – is critical to maintaining financial safety and stability. We will continue to engage with trustees to ensure they are meeting their new obligations. With more assets to invest, trustees are increasingly looking to overseas investment options as well as private unlisted assets to drive returns for members. Increased overseas deployment heightens, among other things, currency risk and increased investment in unlisted assets raises questions about the management of liquidity risk and fair valuation. Transparency Greater industry transparency will further improve outcomes for members. APRA is committed to increasing transparency of retirement product performance and the industry’s progress in implementing the Retirement Income Covenant. We now publish fund-level data on retirement product investment returns and investment strategies. APRA will integrate this data into our Comprehensive Product Performance Package from the second half of 2025-26. This will provide a more comprehensive view of product performance across the superannuation sector. APRA is also working with Treasury to design a new reporting framework on retirement outcomes, which will commence in 2027. This initiative will enable monitoring of the outcomes delivered to members in retirement in a consistent and transparent way. The next step with the Retirement Reporting Framework is for Government to confirm the scope of the framework, following the consultation undertaken by Treasury earlier this year. Getting the balance right Avid readers of APRA’s Corporate Plan 2 will be aware that we added a new strategic objective this year – Getting the Balance Right. This is about our need to balance our financial safety and stability objectives with competition and efficiency considerations. Under that objective we are progressing nine actions to minimise regulatory burden. In addition to the reduction of capital requirements for annuity products which I mentioned earlier, the initiatives include introducing further proportionality, removing unnecessary or duplicative rules, and strengthening data sharing with other agencies. The world is watching The push to improve financial outcomes for fund members in retirement is not unique to Australia. Many jurisdictions around the world are focused on retirement funding for their own ageing populations. But what does set our system apart from many others is the maturity of our compulsory defined contribution system which supports a constant flow of new capital into the superannuation system. The UK, which has previously relied to a greater extent in recent years on a defined benefit system, is transitioning towards a defined contributions model. The development of the UK’s Value for Money framework for defined contribution pension funds, has taken into account Australia’s approach and experience. The strong interest in our system was also evident in my recent meetings with UK pension authorities and regulators and at last month’s International Organisation of Pension Regulators sessions. Conclusion In closing, Australia’s superannuation system is, in many respects, the envy of the world. But we know it’s not perfect. It introduces complexity at a time in members’ lives when they don’t want complexity. To keep superannuation a world class system, trustees need to respond to the challenges arising from the three powerful drivers of change that are shaping the industry. That means doing more to improve outcomes for members in retirement. Doing more to build operational resilience as the system continues to expand. And doing more to understand the systemic significance of superannuation, not just at a fund level, but in the context of the broader financial system. Trustees must be equipped and capable to meet the challenges – both risks and opportunities lie ahead. Thank you Footnotes 1. The Sydney Morning Herald Sat 8 October 1842 08 Oct 1842 - Trove 2.

The Points of Presence Statistics are a detailed listing of the physical banking service channels provided to Australians, including branches, ATMs and EFTPOS facilities. As the national data collection agency for the financial sector, APRA collects points of presence information from ADIs and publishes it annually. The latest statistics show the ongoing trend of a decline in physical points of presence over the last year, albeit at a slower rate than previous years. The number of bank branches nationwide fell 4.6 per cent between June 2024 and June 2025. Regional and remote areas experienced the smallest fall recorded since this data series began (1.9 per cent), due in part to a moratorium on regional branch closures agreed between the Government and major banks in February this year. These statistics do not cover the entirety of banking service channels. Trends in physical banking service channels provided by ADIs should be considered in the broader context of increased usage of digital banking services and the presence of other service providers. APRA encourages industry bodies to work together to provide increased transparency on this matter. For example, as the industry association for the payments system, the Australian Payments Network publishes data on ATMs, including those operated by third parties. APRA has also concluded its review of Points of Presence data for ADIs. Further details are available in APRA’s response letter . Copies of the latest ADI Points of Presence Statistics are available on the APRA website at: Authorised deposit-taking institutions' points of presence statistics .

The Review highlights that Australia’s financial system remains well positioned to navigate a period of elevated global uncertainty. The RBA views the largest risks to financial stability as coming from abroad: High and rising government debt levels in major economies. Stretched asset valuations and leverage in global markets. Heightened geopolitical and operational risks. However, the RBA finds that Australian households, businesses and banks are well placed to weather most shocks: Most households with mortgages are keeping up with repayments and have built savings buffers. Many businesses have established financial buffers. Australian banks continue to maintain high levels of capital and liquidity, positioning them to support the economy through potential disruptions.

This was part of a global survey that involved central banks and authorities from 52 jurisdictions and was coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to obtain comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of FX and OTC derivatives markets. Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986 for activity in FX markets and since 1995 for OTC interest rate derivatives markets. Globally, the Australian dollar is the seventh most traded currency, down from sixth in the previous survey, and its share of turnover remained stable around 6 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the sixth most traded currency pair globally, accounting for around 5 per cent of all transactions. Activity in Australia’s FX market in April 2025 reached its highest level on record. The survey was conducted during a period of heightened FX volatility and a surge of trading activity following several trade policy announcements by major economies. Average daily turnover in Australia’s FX market increased by 34 per cent to US$201 billion per day in April 2025, from US$150 billion in April 2022. [1] Australia’s FX market remains the the 11th largest in the world. In the Australian FX market the majority of turnover remained in FX swaps, accounting for around 53 per cent of total turnover. Spot transactions accounted for 25 per cent of Australian turnover, up from 23 per cent in 2022, and outright forwards accounted for 18 per cent of Australian turnover, little changed from the previous survey. Activity in the Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased sharply since the previous survey. Average daily turnover in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased by 123 per cent to US$252 billion during April 2022, reflecting an increase in turnover of interest rate swaps. The preliminary results of the global turnover survey are available from the BIS website. The final data and related analysis will be released by the BIS in December 2025. Links to other participating jurisdictions’ results are available from the BIS website. More detailed results for the Australian market are available on the 2025 BIS Triennial Survey Results – Australia page. The BIS will also publish global data on amounts outstanding in OTC derivatives markets in November 2025. Endnote Australian data are reported on a “net-gross” basis, correcting for local inter-dealer double counting only. Global data are reported on a “net-net” basis, correcting for both local and cross-border inter-dealer double counting. 1 Enquiries Communications Department Reserve Bank of Australia SYDNEY Phone: +61 2 9551 8111 Email: rbainfo@rba.gov.au",

    "full_text": "Media Release Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision Number 2025-27 Date 30 September 2025 At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent. The decline in underlying inflation has slowed. Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. Both headline and trimmed mean inflation were within the 2–3 per cent range in the June quarter. Recent data, while partial and volatile, suggest that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of the August Statement on Monetary Policy . Domestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain. Data for the June quarter show that private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected, taking over from public demand as the driver of growth. In particular, private consumption is picking up as real household incomes rise and measures of financial conditions ease. The housing market is strengthening, a sign that recent interest rate decreases are having an effect. Credit is readily available to both households and businesses. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions have been broadly steady in recent months and remain a little tight. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected, but the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 per cent in August. Measures of labour underutilisation remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour has been little changed of late. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but productivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both domestic and international developments. On the domestic side, stronger-than-expected data on growth and inflation may indicate that households have become more comfortable consuming as real incomes and wealth rise. If this continues, it may make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases and lead to more demand for labour. Alternatively, the recent growth in consumption might not persist, particularly if households become more concerned about overseas developments. Uncertainty in the global economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on global economic growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat to the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions in the domestic economy. There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing, the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and the outlook for productivity. Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority. With signs that private demand is recovering, indications that inflation may be persistent in some areas and labour market conditions overall remaining stable, the Board decided that it was appropriate to maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the beginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full effects of earlier cash rate reductions. The Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of uncertainty about the outlook. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Decision Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank’s Financial Stability Standards (Standards). ASX has considerable work to do to meet the Bank’s expectations for an operator of critical market infrastructure. Recent shortcomings in risk management – particularly the December 2024 CHESS batch settlement incident – have highlighted that ASX must make foundational changes to its governance, culture and risk management processes. ASX must also accelerate its uplift of operational and financial risk management, while meeting key milestones for its major technology projects. Delivering on these initiatives will require appropriate resourcing and the RBA will be closely monitoring progress over the coming year. The ASX CS facilities were rated as having ‘observed’ or ‘broadly observed’ many of the individual Standards. The Bank assessed that one or more of the CS facilities ‘partly observed’ requirements under the specific Standards on the Framework for Comprehensive Management of Risks, Governance, Credit Risk, Settlement Finality, and Operational Risk. ASX Clear and ASX Settlement continue to be rated as ‘not observed’ on the Operational Risk Standard, following the Bank’s out-of-cycle assessment against this Standard in March 2025. The Bank has issued a number of recommendations, including that ASX should: obtain assurance that it has addressed gaps in its risk appetite statement and strategy to return to risk appetite ensure its risk transformation plan is appropriately resourced and implement regular reporting on the plan conduct a review of business continuity and contingency arrangement across the CS facilities comprehensively improve data and reporting controls for financial risk models and address issues identified in the assessment period. RBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said: ‘ASX is not currently meeting the regulators’ expectations for an operator of critical national infrastructure. Resilient and secure CS facilities are crucial to the stability of the Australian financial system. ‘This assessment highlights that ASX still has more work to do to in strengthening its governance, risk culture, and frameworks for managing operational and financial risk. We are expecting meaningful progress over the coming year and will consider further regulatory responses if necessary.’ Background The Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on financial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed on a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards determined by the Bank. The Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX’s four CS facilities: two central counterparties – ASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited – and two securities settlement facilities – ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited. These assessments include a rating of the CS facilities’ observance against each financial stability standard. For more information on the Bank’s approach to assessing CS facilities, see: The Reserve Bank’s Approach to Supervising and Assessing Clearing and Settlement Facility Licensees . ASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the supervision of CS facilities. In carrying out supervision of CS facilities, the RBA works closely with ASIC.

    "full_text": "Media Release Payments System Board Update: August 2025 Meeting Number 2025-23 Date 28 August 2025 At its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including: The regulatory response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024. The Board reviewed ASX’s plans to ensure the current CHESS is adequately operated, maintained and supported as a critical financial market infrastructure. Members noted that early progress is being made and agreed that significant concerns remain. The Board also agreed on further regulatory steps to ensure CHESS Replacement is designed with an appropriate level of resilience for critical financial market infrastructure. The annual Assessment of the ASX clearing and settlement facilities against the Financial Stability Standards . The Board endorsed the RBA’s Assessment, which will be published after it has been provided to ASX, the Treasurer and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Members observed that ASX has made limited progress in addressing the RBA’s fundamental concerns in relation to operational resilience and risk management over the past year. ASX’s response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024 and its aftermath has also demonstrated that ASX must take urgent steps to improve its governance and risk culture. The successful delivery of ASX’s current risk management, technology and transformation initiatives is crucial to the continuity of services that are critical to the stability of the Australian financial system. The RBA’s oversight of international financial market infrastructures , including LCH SwapClear, CME, Clearstream Banking, Euroclear Bank, CLS and Swift. Many of these infrastructures are engaged in complex, multi-year transformation programs to modernise systems and enhance resilience. Members emphasised the importance of strong project governance, testing and migration strategies to support the ongoing safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. Members also discussed the risks associated with growing reliance by financial market infrastructures on a small number of critical third-party service providers. The Board welcomed ASIC’s decision to grant Clearstream Banking a clearing and settlement facility licence. Members highlighted the importance of the RBA and ASIC, as co-regulators of clearing and settlement facilities operating in Australia, having sufficient oversight of such facilities. The system-wide resilience of the Australian payments system. The Board highlighted the growing importance of operational resilience in the context of a more complex and challenging environment for operational risk in the payments system. Regulators and entities will need to increase their focus on system-wide interdependencies. The Board endorsed an ongoing research program examining interoperability, third-party and concentration risks, resilience arrangements for high-value payments and the vulnerability of the payments system to utilities outages. The future of cash distribution arrangements. Members discussed the challenges in the cash distribution system. There is an ongoing need for industry cooperation to work towards a more durable future distribution system that supports the availability of cash in the community, including in rural and regional Australia. Cash remains an important means of payment for many Australians and can play a valuable role as a back-up to electronic payments, as part of a resilient and inclusive payments ecosystem. Members noted that a new proposed regulatory framework for providers of cash distribution services, which was the subject of a recent CFR and ACCC consultation, should contribute to the management of risks relating to the continuity of cash distribution services across Australia. Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging. The Board was provided with an update on the initial responses of stakeholders to the Consultation Paper published in July. Members noted feedback regarding the potential impact of the proposed card payments regulations on the ability of small issuers and fintechs to compete and innovate. Members held a preliminary discussion on whether there is a case to reduce the regulatory burden of card payments regulations on small issuers and what options might best support this objective. The issue will be considered further as part of the consultation process for the Review. Global developments in stablecoins. Members discussed the recent sharp growth in the global stablecoin market, noting the market is largely concentrated in a small number of US dollar stablecoins. Members discussed the expansion in potential use cases for stablecoins, including as a means of payment and in cross-border transactions. They also considered the emerging regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. While the stablecoin market in Australia is currently very small, members discussed a range of potential domestic implications if the use of stablecoins were to grow considerably. The Board also welcomed the Government’s proposed reforms aimed at ensuring that stored-value facilities, including stablecoins, operate under a strong regulatory and licencing regime.

    "full_text": "Media Release Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision Number 2025-22 Date 12 August 2025 At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60 per cent. Inflation has continued to moderate. Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. In the June quarter, trimmed mean inflation over the year fell to 2.7 per cent, broadly as expected in May. Headline inflation, which has partly been affected by temporary cost of living relief measures, was 2.1 per cent, also as forecast. Updated staff forecasts for the August meeting suggest that underlying inflation will continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a gradual easing path. The outlook remains uncertain. Uncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on global economic activity, and there remains a risk that households and firms delay expenditure pending still greater clarity on the outlook. As in May, the forecasts assume that both effects weigh on activity and inflation in Australia for a period. Domestically, private demand appears to have been recovering gradually, real household incomes have picked up and some measures of financial conditions have eased. Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, although have eased further in recent months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in the month of June and averaged 4.2 per cent in the June quarter as a whole, in line with the May forecasts. Measures of labour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour is still a constraint for a range of employers. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak but productivity growth has not picked up and growth in unit labour costs remains high. There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both domestic and international developments. The forecasts released today are for the recovery in household consumption growth to be sustained as real incomes rise. Businesses in some sectors, however, continue to report that weakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases to final prices. There is a risk that consumption growth is a little slower than expected, which could weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions. Alternatively, as real incomes and wealth continue to rise, households might choose to consume more and save less than expected. Labour market outcomes may also prove stronger than expected, given the signal from a range of leading indicators. There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how firms’ pricing decisions and wages will respond to the balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and continued weak productivity outcomes. Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority. With underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the 2–3 per cent range and labour market conditions easing slightly, as expected, the Board judged that a further easing of monetary policy was appropriate. This takes the decline in the cash rate since the beginning of the year to 75 basis points. The Board nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty about both aggregate demand and potential supply. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia. The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome. Decision Today’s policy decision was unanimous.

    "ai_summary": "This statement from the Monetary Policy Board outlines their decision to lower the cash rate target and the rationale behind it.

Here's a summary for compliance officers and business executives:\n*   **Cash Rate Reduction:** The Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60 per cent.\n*   **Inflation Moderation:** Underlying inflation is falling, and is expected to continue to decline towards the midpoint of the 2-3 per cent range.\n*   **Economic Uncertainty:** The Board acknowledges heightened uncertainty in the global economy, including trade policy developments and their potential adverse effects. Domestically, while demand has been recovering, risks remain regarding consumer spending and the labour market.\n*   **Labour Market Conditions:** While labour market conditions remain tight, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in June. Wages growth has eased from its peak, but productivity growth has not picked up.\n*   **Forward Guidance:** The Board remains cautious and will closely monitor global and domestic economic developments, inflation outlook, and labour market trends to guide future policy decisions. They are prepared to respond decisively to international developments that could materially impact Australia's economic activity and inflation.",

    "risk_rationale": "The RBA's decision to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60% signals a moderate impact. This easing of monetary policy, the third this year totaling 75 basis points, will likely necessitate adjustments to financial models and pricing strategies across various sectors. The statement highlights \"process/system changes\" with \"moderate resources\" as institutions adapt to the revised interest rate environment. The RBA explicitly mentions that they remain \"cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty,\" implying that further adjustments, and thus further compliance needs, may be necessary in the near future.",
