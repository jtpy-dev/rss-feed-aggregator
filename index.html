Introduction
Good morning, all. I begin by acknowledging the Traditional Custodians of lands, waterways and skies across Australia. I pay my respects to the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and Bunurong people, on whose country we meet today, and honour their culture and Elders, past and present. I also extend my respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are here today.
It is a pleasure to be partnering with Monash University to deliver this inaugural Australian Competition Summit. And to bring together, from across the world, people who understand and commit our working lives to competition law and economics. Who know the importance of evidencing competition in operation and the benefits it brings.
This summit is timely for many reasons. Next week we will mark the 30
th
anniversary of the ACCC which began operations on 6 November 1995 with the amalgamation of the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority. The landmark competition legal and policy reforms of the early 1990s that ushered in the ACCC delivered extended coverage of competition law, new access and infrastructure regulation, and important national competition policy actions. And for three decades, that approach has proved robust and adaptable.
But today’s economic, societal and geopolitical developments present new challenges and require renewed commitment and shared insights on how we promote competition and protect consumers.
30 years ago, I was closely engaged in the reforms to move Australia from monopoly to duopoly in telecommunications services. I had provided advice to the Commonwealth Government on the rights and immunities of carriers to be legislated to enable rapid expansion of telecommunications networks.
After, I was subsumed in the negotiation of the interconnection and facilities access agreement for Optus (the then shareholders were Cable & Wireless, Bell South and Continental Cablevision) with Telstra.
By 1995, I had moved on to negotiating agreements with Movie Studios and sports right holders to secure the content for Optus Vision pay tv services.
Those experiences taught me important lessons about the necessary regulatory frameworks, the critical technical and engineering elements for interconnection and interoperability and the difficulty of securing the foundations for successful entry. What strikes me today is that while technology, business models and markets have changed fundamentally, the challenges we faced and the mistakes we may have made remain relevant.
As chair of the ACCC, this year has arguably been the most interesting of my three years in the role. The level of disruption in competition law and policy, the significant expansion and critical status of global digital platforms, the push to net-zero transition, and domestic and global productivity and cost-of-living concerns, are just a few of the forces shaping the ACCC’s competition work. Work that includes implementing merger reform, regulating infrastructure in concentrated markets, making a panoply of statutory decisions and running major enforcement cases.
In the context of rapid and fundamental change, it is clear to me that we must not simply react to disruptive forces. We must lead with principle and purpose, informed by a strong evidence base.
So, this Summit is timely. It brings us together to understand the lessons from the past and the challenges of the present. And to look forward, to test ideas, and to share emerging approaches.
The promise of competition
One of the key challenges that the ACCC is focused upon is that around the world, trust in institutions and governments is declining.
A recent survey of more than 33,000 people across 28 countries (including Australia), showed that a majority of respondents hold a moderate or high sense of grievance. A belief that the system favours the privileged – that business and government, including regulators, serve a select few and act in ways that hurt the community. And only a third believe that the next generation will be better off
[1]
.
Alongside this decline in trust, we are also seeing signs that consumer awareness and expectations of competition are changing. In Australia, public attention on sectors such as aviation, supermarkets and digital services reflects an increased scrutiny of household budgets in the context of uncertainty and high cost-of-living. But it also reflects the expectation that competition should deliver tangible outcomes on price, choice, quality and service.
This expectation matters. It is enshrined in the object of our Competition and Consumer Act, that the promotion of competition is not an end in itself. Rather, that we work to promote competition to enhance the welfare of our community. And in this time of disruption, and diminishing consumer trust, it is more important than ever that we deliver on our mandate. That we strongly articulate the case for competition in a contested public policy environment. That we demonstrate the benefits of regulatory interventions to protect the process of competition. And that we ensure that our work delivers outcomes that are valued by the communities we serve.
To kick start today’s discussions, I would like to use this speech to reflect on the ways in which we can lead to fulfil this responsibility:
through collaboration with our international partners
through change with right-sized regulation
through action with robust competition enforcement, including merger control
and through disruption using new approaches to anticipate and prevent harm
International partnerships: leading through collaboration
First to leadership through collaboration with our international partners.
It is a privilege to be joined at this Summit by regulators, experts, policy makers, advisers, and academics from across the Asia-Pacific region, North America, United Kingdom and Europe.
As Chair of the ACCC, I have learnt and benefited from our engagement in the international competition community as we each seek answers to very similar questions and challenges.
While the ACCC undertakes investigations independently our effectiveness is strengthened by the trusted relationships built over many years of international engagement.
Through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Competition Network, our long-standing program with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and newer collaborations such as the PINCCER network, an important forum for competition, consumer and economic regulators across the Pacific – we are sharing intelligence, common challenges and new ways of working.
These relationships help us to align elements of reform where appropriate. To identify emerging risks before harm becomes entrenched. And to ensure that competition law is grounded in strong forensic discipline, the best economic analysis and a vision for expanded application, as markets transform at an extraordinary pace.
Right-sized regulation: leading through reform
While overseas jurisdictions may operate within different legal traditions, economic pressures and political contexts – competition regulators worldwide face similar tensions. How to be the tough cop on the beat as expected by the community without being viewed as over restrictive. How to be firm without abandoning proportionality. And how to enable dynamism and economic growth without giving licence to harm.
At the ACCC, we are navigating this with a commitment to right-sized regulation. That is, intervention that is rigorous where harm is greatest and proportionate to risk. And advocating for targeted reform to advance the protection and promotion of competition and the diversification of innovation.
This means advocating for both the introduction of new legislation where it is needed, and the removal or updating of regulation that is no longer fit for purpose. This principle is in action at the ACCC across our broad range of work in merger reform, digital platforms, telecommunications, product safety and scams prevention.
Merger reform
When the Treasurer introduced the new merger regime to Parliament late last year, he described it as a reform directed at boosting competition and productivity.
These reforms seek to strike the right balance between seeing and preventing the small number of anti-competitive acquisitions, while allowing those that are unlikely to raise competition issues to proceed promptly and with certainty. Importantly, the design of the new regime – and the ACCC’s committed approach to its delivery  – has focused on regulatory timeliness, transparency and predictability. This includes clear processes for engaging with parties, competing businesses, suppliers, customers and the broader community.
The new regime aims to give businesses greater clarity, consumers greater confidence and aligns Australia with best practice in merger control across OECD economies. And it is a topic we will be discussing in more depth later today.
Digital platforms
Right-sizing regulation is also at the centre of our recommendations for digital platform competition measures. This proposed regulatory framework, closely aligned to the UK model, includes targeted service-specific codes of conduct for designated critical intermediary platforms.
This model can respond quickly to technological and business model change, support pro-competitive innovation through interoperability and contestability, provide more choice and lower cost for Australian consumers and businesses and be designed to be coherent with the regulatory frameworks being developed and implemented in other jurisdictions.
Such a targeted code-based regime would complement competition law enforcement to ensure that Australians can enjoy the benefits of competitive digital services.
Telecommunications
Meanwhile, in telecommunications, as new technologies have emerged, the ACCC has right-sized regulation by adjusting our settings to ensure we only regulate when necessary.
For example, in response to technological change and the rollout of the NBN, we no longer regulate wholesale services providing access to Telstra’s copper network. We have also significantly cut back wholesale regulation of telecommunications transmission services.
This change in settings has been in response to significant industry investment in fibre – driven by cloud computing, hyperscale data centres, and growing demand for enterprise connectivity.
Product safety
We also have advocated for, and support the discipline of, right-sizing regulation in our product safety remit. Following enabling amendment to the Australian Consumer Law, the ACCC is conducting prioritised review of international safety standards to assess where they provide the same or greater protection than Australian national standards. This will allow businesses supplying products in Australia to comply by conforming to international standards, including as they change over time. This will reduce compliance costs, enable access to global supply chains, and increase consumer choice
without
compromising safety.
Across all of this work, the principle is the same: regulation that is fit for purpose, proportionate in design and implementation, and directed at the greatest harms to consumers.
Leadership through action: competition enforcement
Which leads me to my next point: demonstrating our leadership through competition enforcement.
In August at our Regulatory Conference Margrethe Vestager said in relation to ex-ante regulation, that policy without legislative obligation and sanctions is just a suggestion. By extension, enforcement action is how competition agencies demonstrate, case-by-case, that business is accountable for anti-competitive behaviour and that harm will be addressed. Strong enforcement record is necessary for building public trust.
At the ACCC, our enforcement work over the past year reflects this discipline. And it reflects the breadth of tools available – from compliance engagement and education to enforceable undertakings and litigation – to address conduct that harms consumers and the competitive process. And to achieve outcomes that are proportionate to the conduct and its harm.
Just this week, we accepted an enforceable undertaking for resale price maintenance that strikes a balance between addressing the conduct and its harm, while being fair to the relatively small trader involved. We take resale price maintenance very seriously because it stops retailers from competing on price and can increase what consumer pay.
Our recent action against Google demonstrates in practice our ability to combine enforcement tools to achieve an outcome that most benefits competition and consumers in a timely way.
As most in this room will already know, Google admitted to breaching Australia’s competition law in relation to pre-installation and placement of Google Search on Android devices and agreed to jointly submit to the court that it should pay a penalty of $55 million. It will be a matter for the court to determine appropriate orders, including penalty.
Importantly, we also secured a court-enforceable undertaking from Google, with commitments to modify the way it distributes Google Search in Australia. These commitments are designed to deliver tangible benefits, providing the opportunity for choice for millions of Australian consumers. And opening up competition on the merits.
In addition to these cases, through our action against cartels, we have been clear that collusion – in any sector and at any scale – is incompatible with competition and will be met with serious consequences.
We have recently seen the Full Federal Court uphold decisions in favour of the ACCC in our cartel cases against Delta Building Automation and BlueScope Steel.
We have also announced two new civil cartel proceedings in recent months: one alleging price fixing in the supply of fresh produce to ALDI. Another alleging price fixing and/or supply restriction by major suppliers of mobile crane services in Sydney. These cases cut to the core of markets that matter to Australians – our food supply chains and the construction and infrastructure sectors that underpin our economy.
And beyond these cases, we continue to pursue other important matters before the courts, including our misuse of power case against Mastercard and our civil cartel case against Spotless and Ventia.
In each of these matters, the decision to take action is driven by public interest and grounded in evidence – a clear assessment of harm, competitive impact and consumer welfare.
Taken together, these proceedings illustrate the complexity and force of contested competition litigation. They also show our resolve to take action where important to secure specific and general deterrence of anti-competitive conduct in all its forms.
Leadership through disruption: new approaches to anticipate and prevent harm
As I noted at the start of this speech, leadership in the promotion of competition is not just about reacting to disruptive forces but influencing and shaping outcomes. As such, competition enforcement involves not only responding to reported harm, but proactively anticipating risk, detecting patterns, and disrupting anticompetitive conduct before its impact becomes entrenched.
This approach is seen in our work in cartels, where last month, we announced a partnership with the NSW government to obtain rich procurement data sets.  We will apply data analysis led techniques to identify suspicious patterns to detect and deter bid rigging in public procurement.
We have also drawn on lessons from global experiences. Ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Japan Fair Trade Commission uncovered an alleged bid-rigging cartel involving contracts worth nearly 540 million Yen. Several criminal convictions were secured, including a 22-month suspended prison sentence for a former government executive, and fines imposed by the Japan Fair Trade Commission totalling 3.3 billion Yen.
The Spanish and South Korean competition agencies are now using advanced data analysis and AI applied to procurement data to identify the majority of bid rigging cases that they investigate and prosecute.
Conclusion
To conclude, we a community of regulators, policy makers, expert economists and lawyers, researchers and advisers come together at a critical time. Faced by the challenges of significant technological and business model disruption, increasing market concentration, geopolitical uncertainty, conflicting public policy pressures and the need to build community trust we have a critical role to play. It is important to both articulate clearly and demonstrate in action what competition means and the benefits it brings.
We understand we will be most effective when law design and enforcement is principled, proportionate and grounded in the public interest. By sharing our experiences and learning from each other, we advance our stewardship of competition policy and law at a pivotal time.
Thank you.

Compliance and enforcement
Connected Audio Visual Pty Ltd has admitted to engaging in resale price maintenance. The company did this by communicating that it would not supply retailers who did not agree to terms requiring them to sell products at specified prices.
The ACCC accepted a court enforceable undertaking addressing this conduct.
In April 2025, the technology solutions provider sent emails to 258 retailers proposing changes to certain clauses in their distribution agreements. Connected Audio Visual asked these retailers to agree to advertising certain products online, such as dash cams and subwoofers, at the recommended retail price. Existing retailers who did not respond to the emails had their accounts put on hold and in one instance, when the retailer did not agree, closed.
Under Australia’s competition laws, it is illegal for suppliers to prevent, or attempt to prevent, retailers from advertising or selling goods below a specific price. This conduct is known as resale price maintenance.
Between April and September 2025, in response to Connected Audio Visuals conduct, 178 existing and 31 new retailers entered into agreements containing resale price maintenance clauses with Connected Audio Visual.
“Recommended resale prices are only suggestions, and suppliers are generally prohibited from trying to force distributors to adopt them,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
“As we have seen in this instance, suppliers often do this by pausing or cancelling accounts with businesses who refuse to comply.”
“We enforce these laws to protect consumers from higher costs, which can happen when retailers are prevented from competing on price,” Mr Keogh said.
“We will continue to take decisive action against companies who flout our competition laws utilising the full suite of enforcement actions available to us.”
The undertaking, which is in effect for three years, requires Connected Audio Visual to remove the clauses of concern from its distribution agreements and price lists and to inform its retailers it has done so. Connected Audio Visual is also required to implement a compliance program to help it comply with the Competition and Consumer Act.
A copy of the undertaking is available at
Connected Audio Visual Pty Ltd

Background
The ACCC first received a complaint about the conduct in April 2025.
In addition to providing entertainment, security and energy management solutions for homes and businesses in NSW, Connected Audio Visual also supplies car audio and dash cam products to independent retailers across the country. It is the exclusive Australian distributor of IROAD and MB Quart products – dash cam and car audio brands respectively.
Connected Audio Visual admits that it engaged in resale price maintenance and cooperated with the ACCC throughout the investigation.
It is illegal for businesses of any size to impose minimum prices for the resale of their goods or services. For example, suppliers must not:
set minimum prices in formal policies or agreements;
offer retailers a discount if they sell at or above a minimum price;
refuse to supply retailers that sell below a minimum price; or
punish retailers for selling below a set price, for example, by taking away a discount or sending a warning.
Suppliers can recommend appropriate prices including, for example, by providing a recommended resale price (RRP) list. More information on minimum resale prices can be found on
our website

Compliance and enforcement
The ACCC has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Microsoft Australia and its parent company Microsoft Corporation for allegedly misleading approximately 2.7 million Australian customers when communicating subscription options and price increases, after it integrated its AI assistant, Copilot, into Microsoft 365 plans.
The ACCC alleges that since 31 October 2024, Microsoft has told subscribers of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans with auto-renewal enabled that to maintain their subscription they must accept the integration of Copilot and pay higher prices for their plan, or, alternatively, cancel their subscription.
The ACCC alleges this information provided to subscribers was false or misleading because there was an undisclosed third option, the Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic plans, which allowed subscribers to retain the features of their existing plan, without Copilot, at the previous lower price.
Microsoft’s communication with subscribers did not refer to the existence of the “Classic” plans, and the only way subscribers could access them was to begin the process of cancelling their subscription. This involved navigating to the subscriptions section of their Microsoft account and selecting “Cancel subscription”. It was only on the following page that subscribers were given the option to instead move to the Classic plan. See a
screenshot of the cancellation page revealing the Classic plan
.
“Following a detailed investigation, we will allege in Court that Microsoft deliberately omitted reference to the Classic plans in its communications and concealed their existence until after subscribers initiated the cancellation process to increase the number of consumers on more expensive Copilot-integrated plans,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.
“The Microsoft Office apps included in 365 subscriptions are essential in many people’s lives and given there are limited substitutes to the bundled package, cancelling the subscription is a decision many would not make lightly.”
“We’re concerned that Microsoft’s communications denied its customers the opportunity to make informed decisions about their subscription options, which included the possibility of retaining all the features of their existing plan without Copilot and at the lower price,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.
“We believe many Microsoft 365 customers would have opted for the Classic plan had they been aware of all the available options.”
Following the integration of Copilot, the annual subscription price of the Microsoft 365 Personal plan increased by 45 per cent from $109 to $159. The annual subscription price for the Microsoft 365 Family plan increased by 29 per cent from $139 to $179.
Microsoft sent two emails and published a blog post to inform auto-renewing subscribers (as of 31 October 2024) about the Copilot integration and the impending price increase that would apply at their next renewal. These three pieces of communication are central to the ACCC’s case.
“We allege that Microsoft’s two emails to existing subscribers and the blog post were false or misleading as they conveyed that consumers had to accept the more expensive Copilot-integrated plans, and that the only other option was to cancel,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.
“All businesses need to provide accurate information about their services and prices. Failure to do so risks breaching the Australian Consumer Law,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.
In establishing its investigation into this matter, the ACCC drew on a significant number of consumer reports, as well as commentary in online forums such as Reddit. Information provided by consumers to the ACCC’s Infocentre was critical to alerting the ACCC to the alleged conduct, particularly in identifying the availability of the Classic plan through subscribers’ cancellation flows.
The ACCC is seeking orders including penalties, injunctions, declarations, consumer redress, and costs.
Consumer response
The ACCC believes the millions of Australian consumers who were allegedly misled by Microsoft about the availability of the Classic plan may have suffered economic harm through the automatic renewal of their subscription with Copilot integration at a higher price.
The ACCC is seeking consumer redress in this case for Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers affected by the alleged conduct.
Existing Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers who have not had their subscription renewed since 8 July 2025 and would like to revert to their previous plan may be able to select the cancel option and follow the steps in the cancellation process until the Classic plan is offered. However, the ACCC notes that the subscription options and prices offered are entirely in Microsoft’s control and could be subject to change at any time.
Example timeline for a subscriber on a Microsoft 365 Personal plan
On 19 April 2024, a consumer purchased an annual Microsoft 365 Personal subscription for $109 and enabled auto-renewal for one year’s time.
On 31 October 2024, Microsoft published a blog post in which it stated:
“
To reflect the value we’ve added over the past decade and enable us to deliver new innovations for years to come, we’re increasing the prices of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family. The price increase will apply to existing subscribers upon their next renewal.
”
On 9 January 2025, the consumer received an email informing them that AI features were being added to their plan and the price of the annual subscription would increase from $109 to $159 starting on 19 April 2025. See a
screenshot of the first email sent to the consumers about the price increase
.
On 13 April 2025, 7 days before their renewal date, the consumer received a second email in which Microsoft stated:
“
We want to let you know about a change to the amount of your next payment. Unless you cancel two days before Saturday, April 19 2025, we’ll charge AUD 159.00 including taxes every year… We’ll tell you if this price ever changes. Cancel any time to stop future charges or change how you pay by managing your subscription in your Microsoft account.
”
On 19 April 2025, the consumer's subscription was automatically renewed at the increased price of $159.  The consumer was not aware that switching to the Classic plan at the existing subscription price of $109 was possible.

Background
Microsoft Pty Ltd (Microsoft AU) is an Australian proprietary company, and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft US), a US-based technology conglomerate. Microsoft AU is the supplier of Microsoft’s proprietary software in Australia, including Microsoft 365 plans.
The ACCC alleges Microsoft US was responsible for preparing and publishing the communications to Australian Microsoft 365 subscribers containing the misrepresentations alleged by the ACCC. The ACCC alleges that Microsoft AU adopted the communications as the seller of Microsoft 365 subscriptions to Australian consumers.
The ACCC’s case only relates to Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans, which are designed for home use. The case does not involve Microsoft 365 subscriptions for business or enterprise.
Microsoft 365 Personal and Family offerings are supplied on a monthly or annual subscription basis, and are comprised of:
software products, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote
collaboration and communication applications like Outlook, Teams and SharePoint
cloud-based services through OneDrive.
Microsoft launched Copilot as its consumer-facing generative AI product in 2023. Copilot was integrated into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions in Australia on 31 October 2024.
In January 2025, the Copilot integration was rolled out across Microsoft 365 worldwide, with varying subscription price increases applying to each jurisdiction.
Competition, product safety, consumer and fair trading issues in the digital economy is a current ACCC
compliance and enforcement priority
.
Maximum penalties
For corporations, the maximum penalty for each breach of the Australian Consumer Law is the greater of:
$50 million
three times the total benefits that have been obtained and are reasonably attributable, or
if the total value of the benefits cannot be determined, 30 per cent of the corporation’s adjusted turnover during the breach turnover period.
Any penalty that might apply to this conduct is a matter for the Court to determine and would depend on the Court’s findings. The ACCC will not comment on what penalties the Court may impose.

Competition and exemptions
Banking and finance
The ACCC has issued a
draft determination
proposing to authorise the Australian Banking Association (ABA) and other industry participants to develop ways to ensure the continued distribution of cash across Australia.
The ACCC also proposes to allow the parties to take certain steps to ensure cash-in-transit services would continue if Armaguard's services were suspended or disrupted. Armaguard is the main national distributor of cash in Australia. The implementation of any other measures would be subject to a separate application for authorisation, if required.
Cash-in-transit services form the basis of the cash distribution system, where physical currency is transported, processed and stored across the country. Cash-in-transit companies service the cash-related needs of banks, large retailers and hospitality venues, and also offer cash management services such as banknote refilling for ATMs.
“We are proposing to grant this authorisation to allow the ABA and other relevant parties to discuss and develop responses to ensure consumers and businesses can continue to access cash,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
“Public access to physical currency is incredibly important, especially for consumers who are reliant on cash payments including those in regional and remote areas.”
The ACCC has included three conditions in its proposed authorisation, one of which requires the ABA to develop initiatives to protect access to cash in remote areas, where there are often fewer options for accessing cash services.
Interim authorisation for this conduct has been in place with conditions since October 2024. The conduct has also been subject to previous ACCC authorisations, including an
interim authorisation
first granted in December 2023.
The ACCC is now seeking submissions on its draft determination.
This draft determination does not relate to the development or implementation of any pricing mechanisms between Armaguard and its major customers. The
ACCC’s website
will be updated with information relating to those issues when an application for authorisation is received from the parties.
Further information about the ABA’s application and how to make a submission by 14 November 2025 is available on the
ACCC's website.
Note to editors
When competitors act together, they require some form of exemption from the ACCC to avoid the risk of breaching competition laws.
ACCC authorisation provides statutory protection from court action for conduct that might otherwise raise concerns under the competition provisions of the
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth).
Broadly, section 91 of the
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth) allows the ACCC to grant an authorisation when it is satisfied that the public benefit from the conduct outweighs any public detriment.

The ACCC has granted 4 authorisations relating to cash-in-transit services since 2023:
On 13 June 2023, the ACCC
granted merger authorisation
to Armaguard and Prosegur Australia to combine their cash distribution, management and other businesses in Australia, and accepted a court-enforceable undertaking, which is a condition of the merger authorisation. Following this merger, Armaguard became the major supplier of cash-in-transit services in Australia.
On 27 May 2024, the ACCC
granted authorisation
with conditions to the ABA, the Customer Owned Banking Association, banks, retailers and other industry participants to allow them to develop responses to support the distribution of cash across Australia.
On 12 September 2024, the ACCC
granted authorisation
with conditions to allow the ABA, its member banks, Australia Post, retailers, supermarkets and other industry participants to collaborate so they can ensure there is continuity of cash-in-transit services. The ACCC’s authorisation allows the parties to collaborate and prepare for any suspension or disruption of cash-in-transit services.
On 25 June 2025, the ACCC
granted authorisation
with conditions for the ABA, and the major banks and retailers (‘the Funding Parties’) to provide financial contributions to Armaguard and discuss and implement operational sustainability and efficiency measures. The ACCC also authorised the parties to discuss and reach agreement on (but not implement) development of an independent pricing mechanism in respect of each (future) cash services agreement with each of the Funding Parties. Authorisation was granted with conditions until 30 June 2026 but does not extend to the implementation of any pricing proposal – the ACCC expects a further application for authorisation of implementation of the pricing proposal in due course.

Mergers and acquisitions
Banking and finance
The ACCC will not oppose Cuscal Limited’s (ASX:CCL) proposed acquisition of payment facilitation supplier Indue Limited after finding that the transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition.
The ACCC’s review focused on how closely Cuscal and Indue compete in the supply of payment facilitation services, particularly to small and mutual bank customers and financial technology companies, known as fintechs.
Payment facilitation services allow organisations, such as small banks and fintechs, to offer payment solutions to other businesses or consumers, such as eftpos and debit card processing.
“Consolidation among smaller banks has reduced the number of customers Cuscal and Indue compete for,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
“Payment facilitation services require significant investment. Achieving greater scale can assist suppliers in making the necessary investments to keep up with advancements in technology, and customer and regulatory requirements.”
The ACCC found that Cuscal and Indue each offer a broader range of payment facilitation services than most of their competitors. However, most customers can source their payment facilitation requirements from multiple suppliers.
“While Cuscal and Indue are two of the larger payment facilitation service providers, there remains a range of other suppliers available to customers across the various payment schemes,” Dr Williams said.
The ACCC requested feedback about the likely impacts of the proposed acquisition from a range of market participants, including 30 small and mutual banks.
“Many of the customers most likely to be impacted by the proposed acquisition were in favour of the transaction progressing,” Dr Williams said.
“As Cuscal and Indue support critical business functions for their customers, many of them considered that the proposed acquisition will deliver efficiencies and support continued investment in products and innovation.”
Also important in the ACCC’s decision was the impact of broader industry trends on competition, including the increasing digitisation of payments that may lower the cost of switching between payment facilitation providers and reduce barriers to entry.
More information on this review can be found here:
Cuscal Limited – Indue Limited
Background
Payment facilitation services enable organisations to offer payment solutions to other businesses or end consumers. Payment facilitation may include connection to one or more of the payment schemes (such as Visa, Mastercard, eftpos and BPAY), BIN sponsorship, card and ATM switching, and credit, debit and prepaid card processing, as well as data and fraud mitigation services and back-office support.
Customers of Cuscal and Indue include other financial institutions such as small or medium sized banks, credit unions, corporates, government agencies that issue payment cards and fintech companies which provide specialised financial products.
The legal test which the ACCC applies is in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which prohibits acquisitions that are likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.

Mergers and acquisitions
The ACCC has decided to oppose MicroStar Logistics LLC’s (MicroStar) proposed acquisition of the assets of Konvoy Holdings Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Konvoy), both of which supply keg pooling services to brewers across Australia.
MicroStar, which operates under the name Kegstar in Australia, and Konvoy are the only suppliers of keg pooling services, which enable brewers to rent kegs on a short-term basis to supply alcoholic drinks on tap to licensed venues.
“Our investigation has found that MicroStar acquiring the assets of Konvoy, the only other provider of keg pooling services in Australia, would be likely to substantially lessen competition,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
While independent brewers can use their own kegs or leased kegs, the ACCC considers that these options generally serve different purposes and would not be a viable alternative should keg pooling prices increase.
For example, owning kegs or renting them under long-term leases may be suitable when independent brewers are located close to the licensed venues, but these models are unlikely to be viable when servicing venues located further away.
“Without competitors, MicroStar could increase prices above a competitive level and reduce services or quality of service for customers,” Dr Williams said.
“Higher prices for keg pooling would have a significant impact on many independent brewers.”
The ACCC noted that Konvoy is in receivership and that its assets may ultimately be liquidated.
“Our view is that if the proposed acquisition does not proceed, the Konvoy business is likely to continue, whether under new or existing ownership; however, we recognise that liquidation of the assets is also a potential outcome,” Dr Williams said.
“If Konvoy’s assets are liquidated, they would likely remain in the market and be available to new or emerging rivals to MicroStar, or to independent brewers.”
More information can be found on the ACCC public register:
MicroStar Logistics, LLC - Konvoy Holdings Pty Limited.
Background
MicroStar is the largest independent keg services company in the United States with operations in the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. It entered the Australian market in 2021 via the acquisition of the Kegstar business from Brambles.
In Australia, Kegstar handles the activities and costs relating to a brewery’s keg use (for example, keg capital costs, reverse logistics, repair and maintenance, and keg management labour) under a pay-per-fill (PPF) model.
Under the PPF model, a brewery will order the number of kegs it requires, these are then delivered to the brewery for them to clean, fill and ship to the brewery’s customers. The brewery provides information on full keg deliveries to Kegstar who then tracks the kegs to the brewery’s customers (i.e. licensed venues), and then Kegstar arranges to collect the empty kegs for further use by its PPF customers. Brewers will pay for this PPF service based on the number of kegs that the brewery refills.
Konvoy operates a keg services business in Australia where it provides keg rentals on a short-term basis, known as “keg pooling”; and it leases kegs on a long-term basis, for a period of 12-60 months, known as “keg leasing”. Under its long-term keg leasing, brewers can lease kegs for their brewery for a monthly fee.
For its keg pooling, Konvoy stores and maintains a fleet of serviced kegs which are delivered to brewers as needed in exchange for a fixed fee. The brewers will then clean, fill and distribute the kegs. Konvoy tracks the kegs and arranges a pickup from the brewer’s customers, usually licensed venues, once they are empty.
In addition to these leasing services, Konvoy offers separate keg maintenance and repair and branding services. It also sells kegs to customers and supplies a tracking technology, known as ‘Katch’, as part of its logistics offering which assists with tracking kegs across the supply chain.
Konvoy entered receivership and administration on 11 March 2025. The Receivers determined that a sales process for Konvoy’s assets would provide the best return to creditors.

Mergers and acquisitions
The ACCC has outlined its preliminary competition concerns with Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd’s proposed acquisition of Telwater Pty Ltd in a Statement of Issues published today.
Telwater is the largest manufacturer and supplier of aluminium trailer boats in Australia and has strong brand recognition throughout the recreational marine industry. Market participants have told the ACCC that a Telwater aluminium trailer boat is a very important product for many dealers.
Yamaha is a leading supplier of outboard motors. It faces competition from outboard motor brands such as Mercury and Suzuki.
The ACCC’s preliminary view is that the proposed acquisition is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the wholesale supply of outboard motors in Australia.
“We are concerned that, following the acquisition, Yamaha would have the ability and incentive to link the wholesale supply of Yamaha outboard motors to Telwater aluminium trailer boats, for example, by requiring dealers of Telwater boats to also become Yamaha outboard motor dealers,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
“This acquisition could make it much harder for other outboard motor suppliers to compete effectively with Yamaha, ultimately reducing the choice and competitive offerings available to consumers.”
The ACCC is also concerned that the merged entity could seek to reduce the access to dealers and customers by rival suppliers of trailer boats.
“Linking the wholesale supply of Yamaha outboard motors with Telwater aluminium trailer boats could limit how effectively existing and future rival wholesale suppliers of aluminium boats and outboard motors can compete post-merger,” Dr Williams said.
“This could ultimately lead to higher prices and reduced choice or quality for consumers seeking to purchase a new aluminium trailer boat or outboard motor.”
The ACCC invites submissions from interested parties in response to the Statement of Issues by 23 October 2025.
More information, including the Statement of Issues, can be found on the ACCC’s website at

Notes to editors
‘Outboard motors’ are standalone systems that are installed to the outside hull of the boat, as opposed to inboard motors which are installed inside the boat’s hull and used for larger boats.
Trailer boats are small marine vessels that can be fitted to a trailer for easy transportation and generally range between 2 – 9 metres in length. Trailer boats can be made from various materials, with the most common being aluminium or fibreglass.
Aluminium boats are primarily used for recreational boating in Australia. Aluminium boats are generally lighter, more durable and generally less expensive than fibreglass boats.
Aluminium boats and outboard motors are complementary products, often purchased by consumers together. The complementary nature of these products is highly relevant to the ACCC’s competition assessment.
More information on how the ACCC considers conglomerate effects can be found in section 4 of the
ACCC’s Merger Assessment Guidelines
.
Background
Yamaha is proposing to acquire 100 per cent of the shares of Telwater from Bombardier Recreation Products Inc (BRP), alongside a property in Coomera, Queensland used to manufacture, fit and warehouse aluminium trailer boats.
Trailer boats are generally used for leisure activities, such as fishing and cruising. Recreational trailer boats typically use an outboard motor.
Yamaha Motor Company Ltd (YMC) manufactures outboard motors in Asia, primarily in Japan, and imports them into Australia by its wholly owned subsidiary, Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd (Yamaha). Yamaha supplies the outboard motors to dealers (retailers) Australia wide. Dealers then supply the outboard motors to end-customers.
Yamaha does not manufacture boats in Australia. YMC subsidiaries manufacture trailer boats overseas for various international markets. Yamaha and a related business have supplied a small number of these trailer boats to dealers in Australia, primarily via a third party Australian distributor. Yamaha also owns the trademarks for a small number of aluminium trailer boat and trailer brands, which were previously licensed to a third party manufacturer and are not currently in use. Yamaha does not supply trailers for boats in Australia.
Telwater manufactures aluminium trailer boats and trailers in Australia and supplies them to dealers, who then sell to end customers. Telwater currently supplies three lines of trailer boats: Quintrex, Stacer and Yellowfin branded boats.
Telwater supplies custom-fitted trailers that are sold together with its boats (branded under Telwater), or loose trailers (under the brand name “Move”) that can be used for any trailer boat. Telwater also supplies a limited number of outboard motors to dealers as part of a package with a Telwater boat and also potentially a trailer. Telwater is a non-exclusive distributor of Mercury outboard motors, with Mercury also supplying its outboard motors to dealers itself and via other wholesalers. Telwater also supplies a very small number of Rotax outboard motors (which are manufactured and distributed by BRP), as part of a package with some of its boats.

Mergers and acquisitions

The ACCC will not oppose Elders Limited’s (ASX: ELD) proposed acquisition of Delta Agribusiness after accepting a court-enforceable undertaking that commits Elders to divest six Delta stores in Western Australia.
Elders and Delta both supply rural merchandise such as agricultural chemicals, seed, fertiliser, animal health products and related services, such as agronomy services, through their retail networks. Both companies also supply rural merchandise at the wholesale level.
“Our review closely considered the likely effect of the proposed acquisition on competition in each local area where both Elders and Delta have a retail store, taking into account the specifics of each local area,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
"We examined the strength of competing retailers, the particular geographic features and size and type of farms, among other factors. We also engaged with a range of stakeholders including farmers, competing retailers, wholesale suppliers, buying groups and industry bodies as part of our review."
“The nature of competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise is more localised than is the case in other retail sectors, partly due to the differences in farming in different local areas, and the importance of local relationships,” Mr Keogh said.
“Following an in-depth review, we were concerned that the proposed acquisition would be likely to substantially lessen competition in several local areas in Western Australia.”
To address these concerns, Elders has undertaken to divest six Delta stores in Western Australia, and the ACCC has accepted their undertaking.
The ACCC considered, and has approved, Independent Rural Pty Ltd as the purchaser for Delta stores in Dalwallinu and Kalannie, and E. E. Muir & Sons Pty Limited (Muirs) as the purchaser for Delta stores in Albany, Hyden, Manypeaks and Wellstead.
“The ACCC considers that the undertaking provided by Elders addresses the competition concerns that would otherwise arise from the proposed acquisition. Independent Rural’s and Muirs’ acquisition of Delta stores in each of these local areas will create a strong, independent and viable long-term competitor to Elders in those six areas,” Mr Keogh said.
The ACCC concluded that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise in other local areas where both Elders and Delta own retail stores.
In its
Statement of Issues
, the ACCC also identified potential competition concerns in the retail supply of rural merchandise at a broader regional, state or national level, and in the wholesale supply of rural merchandise in Western Australia.
Having reviewed additional information and engaged in further market inquiries, the ACCC considers that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise at a broader regional, state or national level, or in the wholesale supply of rural merchandise in Western Australia.
“Ultimately, the ACCC did not consider that the proposed acquisition was likely to substantially lessen competition in any relevant market with the undertaking provided by Elders,” Mr Keogh said.
Further information, including the undertaking accepted by the ACCC, can be found on the ACCC’s public register at

Scam warning:
The ACCC is aware that scammers may call, email or text to falsely offer to help get compensation from various businesses. They may use this media release about compensation to convince people their contact is real.
STOP
– Don’t give money or personal information to anyone if you’re unsure. Scammers will create a sense of urgency. Don’t rush to act. Don’t click on links even if the message appears to come from Optus. Say ‘no’, hang up, delete.
CHECK
– Ask yourself could the call, email or text be fake? Scammers pretend to be from organisations and entities you know and trust. Contact the organisation using information you source independently, so that you can verify if it is real or not.
PROTECT
– Act quickly if something feels wrong. Contact your bank immediately if you lose money. If you have provided personal information call IDCARE on 1800 595 160. The more we talk the less power they have. Report scams to the National Anti-Scam Centre’s Scamwatch service at
scamwatch.gov.au
when you see them.
Telstra has been ordered by the Federal Court to pay a penalty of $18 million for breaching the Australian Consumer Law after it moved almost 9,000 Belong customers to a lower speed plan without telling them.
In October and November 2020, Telstra migrated 8,897 customers on its Belong brand NBN plans from their current plan which provided a maximum upload speed of 40 Mbps to a service that provided a maximum upload speed of only 20 Mbps. The download speed was unchanged at 100Mbps.
Telstra did not tell customers of the change in maximum upload speed in their service at the time of the change.
“The $18 million penalty sends a strong message to all businesses that they cannot mislead consumers by making changes to key aspects of a service without informing customers of those changes” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.
In addition to the penalty, all affected customers have, or will be, remediated by Telstra with a credit or payment of $15 for each month the customer had been on the lower upload speed plan.
The total remediation that Telstra will pay to affected customers exceeds $2.3 million.
“Telstra’s failure to inform customers that their broadband service had been changed denied them the opportunity to decide whether the changed service was suitable for their needs,” Ms Brakey said.
“Misleading pricing and claims in relation to essential services, with a particular focus on telecommunications, is one of ACCC’s current enforcement priorities.”
Telstra made payments to some affected customers prior to the ACCC commencing proceedings. The remaining payments to customers are being made in accordance with a
court-enforceable undertaking
Telstra has given to the ACCC. Those customers will be contacted by Belong via email.
The Court also ordered Telstra to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs. The Court will publish its reasons for judgment at a later date.
Telstra co-operated with the ACCC by making joint submissions to the Court about orders, including in relation to penalties.
Background
Belong was launched by Telstra in 2013 as a low-cost mobile and internet service provider, operating semi-independently in a number of areas, including products, marketing, service, billing and parts of IT.
Upload speed refers to the speed an individual’s internet connection can allow data to be sent from their devices to the internet e.g. sending emails, streaming video calls and conferences.
In May 2020, NBN Co launched a series of new wholesale consumer speed tiers, including a new 100/20Mbps wholesale speed tier, which provided a maximum download speed of 100mbps and a maximum upload speed of 20mbps. This speed tier costs retail service providers $7 less per month than the 100/40Mbps plan on a wholesale level.
The ACCC commenced its
court action
against Telstra on 6 December 2022, and the
Federal Court made findings against Telstra
on 21 February 2025.

Gas supply on Australia’s east coast is expected to improve in the first quarter of 2026, but the outlook still depends on how much uncontracted gas LNG producers decide to export, according to the
ACCC’s latest gas inquiry report
released today.
The report indicates a gas supply surplus of between 2 and 24 petajoules (PJ) is expected for the east coast, depending on what the LNG producers decide to do with their uncontracted gas.
“The Queensland LNG producers have reported a reduction in contracted LNG exports, and now expect to have 22 PJ of uncontracted gas available in the first quarter of next year,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.
“Given ongoing concerns about sufficiency of domestic gas supply, the ACCC will be monitoring whether and how this gas is offered to domestic buyers.”
“Despite the improvement, the supply-demand outlook remains tight in the southern states,” Ms Brakey said.
“For the first time, southern gas producers are not expecting to produce surplus gas in the first quarter of the year, when demand is usually at its lowest. This may create challenges for fully replenishing southern gas storage facilities ahead of winter 2026.”
Regional supply-demand outlook for quarter 1 2026 (PJ)
Source: ACCC analysis of data obtained from gas producers in July 2025 and of the domestic demand forecast (Step Change scenario) from AEMO, Gas Statement of Opportunities (GSOO), March 2025.
Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. The quantity required to meet long-term LNG SPAs includes feed gas requirements (such as fuel) required to produce LNG. LNG producers' uncontracted gas has been zeroed out when negative as this gas must be acquired from the domestic market, either as additional gas production, purchases or a reduction in exports which would have a net 0 impact on the forecast.
Gas suppliers and users have signed more long-term supply deals so far this year, for supply in 2026 and 2027.
But the report found, despite this, the total amount of gas secured under these contracts remains below levels seen before 2022. Most of the contracts are for only one year.
Prices offered by gas producers for 2026 supply eased in the first half of 2025, falling by an average of 2 per cent to $13.12 per gigajoule (GJ) compared to the second half of 2024. In comparison, prices offered by gas retailers for 2026 supply averaged $14.33/GJ.
For 2027, the average price under producer contracts was $13.93/GJ, while retailer contracts averaged $14.30/GJ. Suppliers contracted a total of 18 PJ of gas for 2026 supply, and 21 PJ for 2027.
Gas policy measures have not made a material difference for local users
The report also reviewed the impact of the Gas Market Code (Gas Code), the Commonwealth Heads of Agreement with LNG exporters (HoA) and the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM), following the ACCC’s initial observations reported in June 2025.
The ACCC has found these measures may have added some gas to the local market, but, overall, they have not materially improved outcomes for gas users.
“There are limits to what the gas policy measures can achieve on their own if the underlying causes of inadequate supply and ineffective competition are not addressed,” Ms Brakey said.
“In addition, they may also be having some unintended incentive effects and causing inefficiencies in gas supply negotiations.”
The ACCC’s review has found that the 2023 reforms to the ADGSM appear to have reduced LNG producers’ incentives to make a net contribution to the domestic market.
These changed incentives appear to have had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the risk of domestic supply shortfalls.
Further, since the 2022 HoA was entered into, the volumes of gas being offered and supplied by the LNG producers to the domestic market have declined over time, while LNG export volumes have increased.
The ACCC’s
submission
to the Gas Market Review outlines the ACCC’s experience and observations arising from the inquiry to inform government consideration of reforms to promote longer-term gas market efficiency and measures to ensure that, in the interim, the Code, ADGSM and HoA are fit for purpose.
Background
In 2017, the Australian Government directed the ACCC to conduct a
wide-ranging inquiry
to improve transparency of the gas market in Australia and support its efficient operation, and to monitor gas supply. On 29 August 2025 a
new direction
was made to formally extend the inquiry to 2030 and to establish quarterly reporting.
The ACCC’s next interim report is scheduled for December 2025

Scam warning:
The ACCC is aware that scammers may call, email or text to falsely offer to help get compensation from various businesses. They may use this media release about compensation to convince people their contact is real.
STOP
– Don’t give money or personal information to anyone if you’re unsure. Scammers will create a sense of urgency. Don’t rush to act. Don’t click on links even if the message appears to come from Optus. Say ‘no’, hang up, delete.
CHECK
– Ask yourself could the call, email or text be fake? Scammers pretend to be from organisations and entities you know and trust. Contact the organisation using information you source independently, so that you can verify if it is real or not.
PROTECT
– Act quickly if something feels wrong. Contact your bank immediately if you lose money. If you have provided personal information call IDCARE on 1800 595 160. The more we talk the less power they have. Report scams to the National Anti-Scam Centre’s Scamwatch service at

when you see them.
Optus Mobile Pty Ltd (Optus) has today been ordered by the Federal Court to pay a penalty of $100 million for engaging in unconscionable conduct when selling mobile phones and contracts to hundreds of Australians, and subsequent debt collection in a case brought by the ACCC.
The Court has imposed this penalty after Optus admitted it acted unconscionably, in breach of the Australian Consumer Law, and agreed to make joint submissions with the ACCC to the Court that a total penalty of $100 million was appropriate.
In many instances the affected consumers did not want or need, could not use or could not afford the phones and contracts they were sold and, in some cases, consumers were pursued for debts resulting from these sales.
Many of the affected consumers were vulnerable or experiencing disadvantage, such as living with a mental disability, diminished cognitive capacity or learning difficulties, being financially dependent or unemployed, having limited financial literacy or English not being a first language. Many of the consumers were First Nations Australians from regional, remote and very remote parts of Australia.
“Optus’s conduct in this case was truly appalling, and we welcome the substantial penalty imposed by the Court and the deterrence message that it will send,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.
“During the course of our investigation we heard from many people who had not only experienced significant financial harm, but also emotional distress and fear after being pursued by debt collectors for long periods.”
“A company of Optus’s size should have had better systems and controls in place to identify and stop this sort of behaviour,” Ms Lowe said.
In his decision, Justice O’Sullivan said the consequences of Optus’s conduct were “profound”.
“Numerous individuals experienced severe financial harm, emotional distress, and social shame,” he said.
“Particularly damaging was the heightened risk of losing access to essential telecommunications services when faced with inflated service costs.”
In addition to the financial penalty, Optus has also provided the ACCC with a
five-year court-enforceable undertaking
that it will compensate impacted consumers and improve its internal systems.
Optus’s conduct impacted over 400 consumers and occurred at 16 Optus stores between August 2019 and July 2023. Any consumer who considers they may have been impacted by similar conduct should contact Optus.
Examples of the misconduct included:
putting undue pressure on consumers to purchase a large number of products, including expensive phones and accessories, that they did not want or need, could not use or could not afford;
failing to explain relevant terms and conditions to vulnerable consumers in a manner they could understand, resulting in them not understanding their ongoing payment obligations;
not having regard to whether consumers had Optus coverage where they lived;
selling products and services which Optus knew, or ought reasonably to have known, the consumers could not afford; and
misleading these consumers to believe that goods were free or included as part of a bundle at no additional cost.
Many impacted consumers were supported by local advocates, financial counsellors and carers in trying to seek a resolution with Optus.
“We commend the dedicated and hardworking people who assisted many of the affected consumers, and we also thank the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman for drawing the broader conduct to our attention,” Ms Lowe said.
In the case of Optus’s Mount Isa store, which has now closed, the telco pursued debts in circumstances where its then senior management knew that those debts related to contracts for goods and services that appeared to have been entered into at the Optus Mount Isa Store fraudulently and without consumer knowledge.
Optus’s then senior management became increasingly aware that Optus staff were engaging in the inappropriate sales practices and that Optus’s systems and controls could not stop the conduct. Optus acknowledged it failed to promptly take steps to fix deficiencies in its systems, which allowed the conduct to continue.
Commission-based sales arrangements for Optus’s sales staff had the clear potential to incentivise the inappropriate sales conduct, despite the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code requiring Optus, from 17 June 2022, to have regard to the
ACCC’s best practice recommendations
which recommend businesses avoid commission-based selling because of its potential to exacerbate the vulnerability of consumers.
This case follows similar ACCC action against Telstra, which was ordered in
May 2021
to pay a $50 million penalty for engaging in unconscionable conduct when it sold mobile contracts to 108 First Nations Australians consumers between at least 1 January 2016 and about 27 August 2018.
Examples of the alleged conduct
A First Nations consumer visited an Optus store in a metro area. They were sold multiple Optus mobile plans and services, including two mobile phones, as well as accessories. The Optus sales representative manipulated the credit check, which enabled them to sell the consumer Optus services and products that they could not afford. Despite the details of the sale coming to the attention of Optus’s fraud team, the consumer’s debt in excess of $3,000 was referred to an external debt collection agency. The debt continued to be pursued by Optus for over a year.
In a separate example, Optus entered into four contracts with a consumer who lived with deafness and communicated by Australian Sign Language. Optus staff failed to explain the terms of the consumer’s contract in a manner which they could understand. The consumer was on a disability pension, and the cost of the contracts was more than they could afford. In addition, the consumer did not need and could not use the Optus products and services. It was only with significant time and assistance of the consumer’s support worker that the consumer was able to cancel the contracts.
In 2019, an internal Optus investigation into customer accounts at the Optus store in Mount Isa resulted in a report that stated that the store manager had falsified identification documents and consumer information to create contracts for services, and had used the identities of First Nations consumers who were not aware that their identities had been used. Another report identified 82 contracts that appeared to have been fraudulently completed without consumer knowledge.
After Optus was notified of the conduct that was the subject of the reports, including its senior management at the time, it still referred and sold outstanding debts associated with some of those contracts to third party debt collection and factoring agencies. Some consumers whose identities were associated with the relevant customer accounts were subject to threats of legal proceedings being commenced against them and of reporting defaults to credit reporting bodies. Some customers continued to be pursued by third party collections agencies until as late as July 2024 and Optus had not taken steps to stop that occurring.
The ACCC acknowledges Optus’s cooperation in resolving the Court proceedings at an early stage and providing a court-enforceable undertaking. The undertaking includes:
a 3-year consumer remediation program
changes to remuneration and incentives for Optus sales staff designed to prevent further conduct from occurring
a requirement for Optus to ensure that certain Optus Licensee stores in the Northern Territory, regional Queensland and South Australia are directly operated by Optus
process and system changes, for example improvements to Optus’s complaints handling process for consumers experiencing vulnerability and/or disadvantage, and
a $1 million donation to an organisation facilitating digital literacy of First Nations Australians.
The Court also ordered Optus to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs, by consent.
Optus customer support
Consumers who think they may have been impacted by conduct similar to that
outlined in Optus’s undertaking
to the ACCC can call Optus’s specialist customer care team on 1300 082 820 for further information or support.
They can also visit the
Sales Misconduct Response page
on Optus’s website.
Background
Questions regarding the recent Optus outage affecting triple-0 call services are unrelated to this judgment and should be directed to the
Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA). The ACCC does not have a role in regulating or enforcing compliance with emergency call service regulations and other related rules.
Optus is Australia’s second largest telecommunications provider. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singtel Optus Pty Ltd, a foreign owned private company.
In Australia, Optus’s retail stores are either:
owned and operated directly by Optus RetailCo Pty Ltd; or
owned and operated through third party licensees, through Retail License Agreements. For example, prior to Optus buying back certain stores, all Optus stores in the Adelaide region were owned and operated by Mavaya Pty Ltd, and all Optus stores in the Northern Territory, as well as several in regional Queensland, were owned and operated by Suntel Communications Pty Ltd.
On 31 October 2024, the ACCC commenced
court action against Optus
. The investigation was prompted by a referral from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.
On 18 June 2025, the ACCC announced that
Optus had admitted
to engaging in unconscionable conduct and agreed to a total penalty of $100 million, subject to Court approval.

Compliance and enforcement
The ACCC has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against JustAnswer LLC for allegedly misleading consumers as to its affiliation with Australian Ombudsman or Government agencies and the cost of its online question and answer service, in breach of consumer laws.
It is alleged that from about 1 November 2022, JustAnswer made false or misleading representations via a chat widget on its website that consumers could use the online question and answer service for just AUD$2. However, in addition to paying the $2 joining fee, consumers were signed up to an ongoing subscription costing between around $50 and $90 per month.
The ACCC alleges that consumers were not adequately informed of the ongoing subscription fee and suffered financial harm as a result.
“Had consumers been aware that the total price of the JustAnswer online service cost at least 25 times more per month than the promoted joining fee, they may have chosen not to use it,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.
“Through its chat widget, JustAnswer offered to connect consumers to ‘experts’ in particular subject areas for a one-off fee of $2. The chat widget didn’t disclose any other charges, and the substantially higher ongoing monthly fee was not mentioned until consumers were directed to a payment screen.”
“The monthly subscription fee was shown in a way that we believe many consumers would not have seen,” Ms Lowe said.
“Manipulative online design practices which guide consumers to sign up for subscriptions they do not want or did not intend to buy can cause distress and financial loss.”
In addition to the alleged price misrepresentations, the ACCC alleges JustAnswer misled consumers by purporting that it or its services were sponsored or approved by, or otherwise affiliated with, the Fair Work Ombudsman, an Australian Ombudsman, or an Australian Government department.
“We consider some consumers may have engaged with JustAnswer on the mistaken belief that their questions would be answered by an independent ombudsman, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman,” Ms Lowe said.
“The ACCC commenced this investigation after receiving large numbers of complaints from consumers who claimed they were not aware of the ongoing subscription charges or who thought they were dealing with an Australian government body.”
The ACCC is seeking compensation orders for affected consumers, injunctions, civil pecuniary penalties, publication orders, and costs, as well as declarations that JustAnswer contravened consumer laws and the implementation of a compliance program.
Background
JustAnswer is registered and based in the United States and operates its business in 196 countries, with more than 700 employees.
It provides a service connecting consumers to subject matter ‘experts’ in areas such as medicine, law, accounting and technology, who are available to answer consumers’ questions. This service can be accessed via
JustAnswer’s website
or its Android/iOS app, the latter of which is not subject to allegations in this proceeding.
Consumers who use a search engine to find information on a particular topic may come across search results with links to JustAnswer’s website. This included search ads sponsored by JustAnswer.
In June, the ACCC published the tenth and final report of its
Digital Platform Services Inquiry
, which found consumers continue to face harms from unfair trading practices including manipulative design operations, such as using interfaces that direct consumers to more expensive subscriptions or purchase options, as well as undisclosed sponsorships and subscription traps. A subscription trap is when a business misleads a consumer into signing up for a subscription by representing that they are making a one-off purchase, or by making cancellation of a subscription difficult.
Consumer issues in the digital economy are one of the ACCC’s current enforcement priorities. This includes work in addressing unfair subscription-related practices, including subscription traps.

Release of Financial Stability Review – October 2025
Number
2025-29
Date
2 October 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) today released its October 2025
Financial
Stability Review
, providing
a comprehensive assessment of the health and resilience of Australia’s financial system.
The Review highlights that Australia’s financial system remains well positioned to navigate a period
of elevated global uncertainty.
The RBA views the largest risks to financial stability as coming from abroad:
High and rising government debt levels in major economies.
Stretched asset valuations and leverage in global markets.
Heightened geopolitical and operational risks.
However, the RBA finds that Australian households, businesses and banks are well placed to weather most
shocks:
Most households with mortgages are keeping up with repayments and have built savings buffers.
Many businesses have established financial buffers.
Australian banks continue to maintain high levels of capital and liquidity, positioning them to
support the economy through potential disruptions.
The Review also underscores the importance of financial institutions maintaining prudent lending standards
and strengthening operational resilience.

2025 Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivative Markets
Number
2025-28
Date
1 October 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia has today released a summary of findings from the latest triennial survey of
turnover in foreign exchange (FX) and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives markets that was
conducted in the Australian market in April 2025. This was part of a global survey that involved central
banks and authorities from 52 jurisdictions and was coordinated by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) to obtain comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of FX and
OTC derivatives markets. Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986 for activity in
FX markets and since 1995 for OTC interest rate derivatives markets.
Globally, the Australian dollar is the seventh most traded currency, down from sixth in the previous
survey, and its share of turnover remained stable around 6 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the
sixth most traded currency pair globally, accounting for around 5 per cent of all transactions.
Activity in Australia’s FX market in April 2025 reached its highest level on record. The survey was
conducted during a period of heightened FX volatility and a surge of trading activity following several
trade policy announcements by major economies. Average daily turnover in Australia’s FX market
increased by 34 per cent to US$201 billion per day in April 2025, from US$150 billion
in April 2022.
[1]
Australia’s FX market remains the the 11th largest in the world.
In the Australian FX market the majority of turnover remained in FX swaps, accounting for around
53 per cent of total turnover. Spot transactions accounted for 25 per cent of
Australian turnover, up from 23 per cent in 2022, and outright forwards accounted for
18 per cent of Australian turnover, little changed from the previous survey.
Activity in the Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased sharply since the previous
survey. Average daily turnover in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased by
123 per cent to US$252 billion during April 2022, reflecting an increase in turnover of
interest rate swaps.
The preliminary results of the global turnover survey are available from the BIS website. The final data
and related analysis will be released by the BIS in December 2025. Links to other participating
jurisdictions’ results are available from the BIS website. More detailed results for the Australian
market are available on the
2025 BIS Triennial Survey Results – Australia
page. The BIS will also
publish global data on amounts outstanding in OTC derivatives markets in November 2025.
Endnote
Australian data are reported on a “net-gross” basis, correcting for local inter-dealer double counting
only. Global data are reported on a “net-net” basis, correcting for both local and cross-border
inter-dealer double counting.

Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision
Number
2025-27
Date
30 September 2025
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent.
The decline in underlying inflation has slowed.
Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to
bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. Both headline and trimmed mean
inflation were within the
2–3 per cent
range in the June quarter. Recent data, while partial
and volatile, suggest that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of
the August
Statement on Monetary Policy
.
Domestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain.
Data for the June quarter show that private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected,
taking over from public demand as the driver of growth. In particular, private consumption is picking up
as real household incomes rise and measures of financial conditions ease. The housing market is
strengthening, a sign that recent interest rate decreases are having an effect. Credit is readily
available to both households and businesses.
Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions have been broadly steady in recent months and
remain a little tight. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected, but the
unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 per cent in August. Measures of labour underutilisation
remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour has been little
changed of late. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but
productivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high.
There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
domestic and international developments. On the domestic side, stronger-than-expected data on growth and
inflation may indicate that households have become more comfortable consuming as real incomes and wealth
rise. If this continues, it may make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases and lead to more
demand for labour. Alternatively, the recent growth in consumption might not persist, particularly if
households become more concerned about overseas developments.
Uncertainty in the global economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale
of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely
to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on
global economic growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat
to the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour
market conditions in the domestic economy.
There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing, the
balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour
market and the outlook for productivity.
Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.
With signs that private demand is recovering, indications that inflation may be persistent in some areas
and labour market conditions overall remaining stable, the Board decided that it was appropriate to
maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the
beginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full
effects of earlier cash rate reductions. The Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious,
updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of
uncertainty about the outlook. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to
international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in
Australia.
The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its
decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial
markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is
focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers
necessary to achieve that outcome.

Assessment of ASX Clearing and Settlement Facilities – September 2025
Number
2025-25
Date
24 September 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia today released the
2025
Assessment of the ASX Clearing and Settlement (CS)
Facilities
. This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank’s Financial
Stability Standards (Standards).
ASX has considerable work to do to meet the Bank’s expectations for an operator of critical market
infrastructure. Recent shortcomings in risk management – particularly the December 2024 CHESS batch
settlement incident – have highlighted that ASX must make foundational changes to its governance,
culture and risk management processes. ASX must also accelerate its uplift of operational and financial
risk management, while meeting key milestones for its major technology projects. Delivering on these
initiatives will require appropriate resourcing and the RBA will be closely monitoring progress over the
coming year.
The ASX CS facilities were rated as having ‘observed’ or ‘broadly observed’ many of
the individual Standards.
The Bank assessed that one or more of the CS facilities ‘partly observed’ requirements under the
specific Standards on the Framework for Comprehensive Management of Risks, Governance, Credit Risk,
Settlement Finality, and Operational Risk. ASX Clear and ASX Settlement continue to be rated as ‘not
observed’ on the Operational Risk Standard, following the Bank’s
out-of-cycle
assessment
against this Standard in March 2025.
The Bank has issued a number of recommendations, including that ASX should:
obtain assurance that it has addressed gaps in its risk appetite statement and strategy to return to
risk appetite
ensure its risk transformation plan is appropriately resourced and implement regular reporting on the
plan
conduct a review of business continuity and contingency arrangement across the CS facilities
comprehensively improve data and reporting controls for financial risk models and address issues
identified in the assessment period.
RBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said:
‘ASX is not currently meeting
the regulators’ expectations for an operator of critical national infrastructure. Resilient and
secure CS facilities are crucial to the stability of the Australian financial system.
‘This assessment highlights that ASX still has more work to do to in strengthening its governance, risk
culture, and frameworks for managing operational and financial risk. We are expecting meaningful progress
over the coming year and will consider further regulatory responses if necessary.’
Background
The Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on
financial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed
on a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards determined by the Bank.
The Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX’s four CS facilities: two central counterparties –
ASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited – and two securities settlement
facilities – ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited. These assessments include a rating
of the CS facilities’ observance against each financial stability standard.
For more information on the Bank’s approach to assessing CS facilities, see:
The
Reserve Bank’s Approach to Supervising and Assessing Clearing and Settlement Facility
Licensees
.
ASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the supervision of CS facilities. In carrying
out supervision of CS facilities, the RBA works closely with ASIC.

Payments System Board Update: August 2025 Meeting
Number
2025-23
Date
28 August 2025
At its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including:
The regulatory response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024.
The
Board reviewed ASX’s plans to ensure the current CHESS is adequately operated, maintained and
supported as a critical financial market infrastructure. Members noted that early progress is being
made and agreed that significant concerns remain. The Board also agreed on further regulatory steps to ensure CHESS
Replacement is designed with an appropriate level of resilience for critical financial market
infrastructure.
The annual Assessment of the ASX clearing and settlement facilities against the Financial
Stability Standards
. The Board endorsed the RBA’s Assessment, which will be
published after it has been provided to ASX, the Treasurer and the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission. Members observed that ASX has made limited progress in addressing the
RBA’s fundamental concerns in relation to operational resilience and risk management over the
past year. ASX’s response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024 and its aftermath
has also demonstrated that ASX must take urgent steps to improve its governance and risk culture. The
successful delivery of ASX’s current risk management, technology and transformation initiatives
is crucial to the continuity of services that are critical to the stability of the Australian
financial system.
The RBA’s oversight of international financial market infrastructures
, including
LCH SwapClear, CME, Clearstream Banking, Euroclear Bank, CLS and Swift. Many of these infrastructures
are engaged in complex, multi-year transformation programs to modernise systems and enhance
resilience. Members emphasised the importance of strong project governance, testing and migration
strategies to support the ongoing safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. Members also
discussed the risks associated with growing reliance by financial market infrastructures on a small
number of critical third-party service providers. The Board welcomed ASIC’s decision to grant
Clearstream Banking a clearing and settlement facility licence. Members highlighted the importance of
the RBA and ASIC, as co-regulators of clearing and settlement facilities operating in Australia,
having sufficient oversight of such facilities.
The system-wide resilience of the Australian payments system.
The Board highlighted
the growing importance of operational resilience in the context of a more complex and challenging
environment for operational risk in the payments system. Regulators and entities will need to increase their
focus on system-wide interdependencies. The Board endorsed an ongoing research program examining
interoperability, third-party and concentration risks, resilience arrangements for high-value
payments and the vulnerability of the payments system to utilities outages.
The future of cash distribution arrangements.
Members discussed the challenges in
the cash distribution system. There is an ongoing need for industry cooperation to work towards a more
durable future distribution system that supports the availability of cash in the community, including in
rural and regional Australia. Cash remains an important means of payment for many Australians and can
play a valuable role as a back-up to electronic payments, as part of a resilient and inclusive
payments ecosystem. Members noted that a new proposed regulatory framework for providers of cash
distribution services, which was the subject of a recent CFR and ACCC consultation, should contribute
to the management of risks relating to the continuity of cash distribution services across Australia.
Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging.
The Board was provided with an
update on the initial responses of stakeholders to the Consultation Paper published in July. Members
noted feedback regarding the potential impact of the proposed card payments regulations on the
ability of small issuers and fintechs to compete and innovate. Members held a preliminary discussion
on whether there is a case to reduce the regulatory burden of card payments regulations on small
issuers and what options might best support this objective. The issue will be considered further as
part of the consultation process for the Review.
Global developments in stablecoins.
Members discussed the recent sharp growth in
the global stablecoin market, noting the market is largely concentrated in a small number of
US dollar stablecoins. Members discussed the expansion in potential use cases for stablecoins,
including as a means of payment and in cross-border transactions. They also considered the emerging
regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. While the stablecoin market in Australia is currently
very small, members discussed a range of potential domestic implications if the use of stablecoins
were to grow considerably. The Board also welcomed the Government’s proposed reforms aimed at
ensuring that stored-value facilities, including stablecoins, operate under a strong regulatory and
licencing regime.

Media Release
Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision
Number
2025-22
Date
12 August 2025
At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to
3.60 per cent.
Inflation has continued to moderate.
Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to
bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. In the June quarter, trimmed mean
inflation over the year fell to 2.7 per cent, broadly as expected in May. Headline inflation,
which has partly been affected by temporary cost of living relief measures, was 2.1 per cent,
also as forecast. Updated staff forecasts for the August meeting suggest that underlying inflation will
continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the
2–3 per cent
range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a
gradual easing path.
The outlook remains uncertain.
Uncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale
of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely
to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on
global economic activity, and there remains a risk that households and firms delay expenditure pending
still greater clarity on the outlook. As in May, the forecasts assume that both effects weigh on activity
and inflation in Australia for a period.
Domestically, private demand appears to have been recovering gradually, real household incomes have picked
up and some measures of financial conditions have eased.
Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, although have eased
further in recent months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in the month of June and
averaged 4.2 per cent in the June quarter as a whole, in line with the May forecasts. Measures
of labour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that
availability of labour is still a constraint for a range of employers. Looking through quarterly
volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak but productivity growth has not picked up and growth in
unit labour costs remains high.
There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
domestic and international developments. The forecasts released today are for the recovery in household
consumption growth to be sustained as real incomes rise. Businesses in some sectors, however, continue to
report that weakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases to final prices. There is
a risk that consumption growth is a little slower than expected, which could weigh on growth in aggregate
demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions. Alternatively, as real incomes and wealth continue to
rise, households might choose to consume more and save less than expected. Labour market outcomes may
also prove stronger than expected, given the signal from a range of leading indicators.
There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how
firms’ pricing decisions and wages will respond to the balance between aggregate demand and
potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and continued weak productivity
outcomes.
Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.
With underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the
2–3 per cent
range and labour market conditions easing
slightly, as expected, the Board judged that a further easing of monetary policy was appropriate. This
takes the decline in the cash rate since the beginning of the year to 75 basis points. The Board
nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty
about both aggregate demand and potential supply. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond
decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and
inflation in Australia.
The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions. In
doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends
in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its
mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve
that outcome.

RBA and APRA Update
Their Memorandum of Understanding to Strengthen Cooperation to Support Financial Stability
Number
2025-21
Date
29 July 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have today
published an
updated
Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU), to further strengthen their cooperation and
coordination arrangements in support of financial stability in Australia. The updated MOU sets out the
RBA and APRA’s respective roles and responsibilities for contributing to financial stability, as
well as arrangements for consultation, liaison and information sharing between the two agencies. The MOU
also sets out specific arrangements for coordination between the RBA and APRA in relation to
macroprudential policy, liquidity support, payments policy and crisis management.
Both the RBA and APRA have responsibilities in relation to financial stability in Australia, and it is
therefore important that they continue to engage closely with one other. The RBA and APRA also cooperate
and coordinate with each other and other regulatory agencies on a multilateral basis through the Council
of Financial Regulators. The Council of Financial Regulators has today published an updated
Charter
.
