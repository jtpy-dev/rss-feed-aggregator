APRA revises governance proposals following industry consultation
Friday 24 October 2025

Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has provided an update on its consultation to modernise the prudential framework on governance for banks, insurers and superannuation trustees.
In March,
APRA proposed eight measures
to update its cross-industry prudential standards and guidance on governance for the first time in more than a decade.
During the three-month consultation period, APRA held 57 meetings and roundtables involving over 150 stakeholder organisations and received almost 80 written submissions. Through these engagements, APRA received broad support for the package overall, especially for initiatives that can reduce burden and address regulatory overlap. But APRA also heard caution around the potential impact of some proposals.
Having carefully considered this feedback, APRA has today written to industry advising it will modify three of its original proposals to ensure they don’t impose undue regulatory constraint on boards:
Instead of a tenure limit for non-executive directors of 10 years with the possibility of a two-year extension, APRA now proposes a hard tenure limit of 12 years with short extensions in limited circumstances.
A proposal for banks and insurers to have at least two independent directors (including the chair) not on other group boards will not proceed as originally proposed.
A proposal to require significant financial institutions to engage early with APRA on responsible person appointments and succession planning will also not proceed.
APRA will also clarify or adjust proposals relating to individual director skills, perceived conflicts of interest, and publication of registers of relevant interests and duties.
Chair John Lonsdale said APRA remains committed to uplifting standards of governance in banking, insurance and superannuation.
“Effective governance is fundamental to financial stability and sound risk management. Across our regulated industries, APRA continues to see cases where deficient governance leads to poor prudential outcomes.
“However, in strengthening standards of governance, we want to strike a balance between increased prescription in some areas and making sure we retain sufficient flexibility for different business models.
“We have benefited from the range of feedback from consultation, and today’s update demonstrates that we have listened carefully to the views of stakeholders. These changes will still deliver the uplift in governance standards APRA is seeking but we have found an outcome that works better for all parties.
“APRA will continue to engage with industry as we work towards releasing updated prudential standards and guidance for further consultation in the first half of next year.”
Today’s letter is available on the APRA website at:

The ACCC has issued a
draft determination
proposing to authorise the Australian Banking Association (ABA) and other industry participants to develop ways to ensure the continued distribution of cash across Australia.
The ACCC also proposes to allow the parties to take certain steps to ensure cash-in-transit services would continue if Armaguard's services were suspended or disrupted. Armaguard is the main national distributor of cash in Australia. The implementation of any other measures would be subject to a separate application for authorisation, if required.
Cash-in-transit services form the basis of the cash distribution system, where physical currency is transported, processed and stored across the country. Cash-in-transit companies service the cash-related needs of banks, large retailers and hospitality venues, and also offer cash management services such as banknote refilling for ATMs.
“We are proposing to grant this authorisation to allow the ABA and other relevant parties to discuss and develop responses to ensure consumers and businesses can continue to access cash,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
“Public access to physical currency is incredibly important, especially for consumers who are reliant on cash payments including those in regional and remote areas.”
The ACCC has included three conditions in its proposed authorisation, one of which requires the ABA to develop initiatives to protect access to cash in remote areas, where there are often fewer options for accessing cash services.
Interim authorisation for this conduct has been in place with conditions since October 2024. The conduct has also been subject to previous ACCC authorisations, including an
interim authorisation
first granted in December 2023.
The ACCC is now seeking submissions on its draft determination.
This draft determination does not relate to the development or implementation of any pricing mechanisms between Armaguard and its major customers. The
ACCC’s website
will be updated with information relating to those issues when an application for authorisation is received from the parties.
Further information about the ABA’s application and how to make a submission by 14 November 2025 is available on the
ACCC's website.
Note to editors
When competitors act together, they require some form of exemption from the ACCC to avoid the risk of breaching competition laws.
ACCC authorisation provides statutory protection from court action for conduct that might otherwise raise concerns under the competition provisions of the
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth).
Broadly, section 91 of the
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
(Cth) allows the ACCC to grant an authorisation when it is satisfied that the public benefit from the conduct outweighs any public detriment.
Background
The ACCC has granted 4 authorisations relating to cash-in-transit services since 2023:
On 13 June 2023, the ACCC
granted merger authorisation
to Armaguard and Prosegur Australia to combine their cash distribution, management and other businesses in Australia, and accepted a court-enforceable undertaking, which is a condition of the merger authorisation. Following this merger, Armaguard became the major supplier of cash-in-transit services in Australia.
On 27 May 2024, the ACCC
granted authorisation
with conditions to the ABA, the Customer Owned Banking Association, banks, retailers and other industry participants to allow them to develop responses to support the distribution of cash across Australia.
On 12 September 2024, the ACCC
granted authorisation
with conditions to allow the ABA, its member banks, Australia Post, retailers, supermarkets and other industry participants to collaborate so they can ensure there is continuity of cash-in-transit services. The ACCC’s authorisation allows the parties to collaborate and prepare for any suspension or disruption of cash-in-transit services.
On 25 June 2025, the ACCC
granted authorisation
with conditions for the ABA, and the major banks and retailers (‘the Funding Parties’) to provide financial contributions to Armaguard and discuss and implement operational sustainability and efficiency measures. The ACCC also authorised the parties to discuss and reach agreement on (but not implement) development of an independent pricing mechanism in respect of each (future) cash services agreement with each of the Funding Parties. Authorisation was granted with conditions until 30 June 2026 but does not extend to the implementation of any pricing proposal – the ACCC expects a further application for authorisation of implementation of the pricing proposal in due course.

The ACCC will not oppose Cuscal Limited’s (ASX:CCL) proposed acquisition of payment facilitation supplier Indue Limited after finding that the transaction is unlikely to substantially lessen competition.
The ACCC’s review focused on how closely Cuscal and Indue compete in the supply of payment facilitation services, particularly to small and mutual bank customers and financial technology companies, known as fintechs.
Payment facilitation services allow organisations, such as small banks and fintechs, to offer payment solutions to other businesses or consumers, such as eftpos and debit card processing.
“Consolidation among smaller banks has reduced the number of customers Cuscal and Indue compete for,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
“Payment facilitation services require significant investment. Achieving greater scale can assist suppliers in making the necessary investments to keep up with advancements in technology, and customer and regulatory requirements.”
The ACCC found that Cuscal and Indue each offer a broader range of payment facilitation services than most of their competitors. However, most customers can source their payment facilitation requirements from multiple suppliers.
“While Cuscal and Indue are two of the larger payment facilitation service providers, there remains a range of other suppliers available to customers across the various payment schemes,” Dr Williams said.
The ACCC requested feedback about the likely impacts of the proposed acquisition from a range of market participants, including 30 small and mutual banks.
“Many of the customers most likely to be impacted by the proposed acquisition were in favour of the transaction progressing,” Dr Williams said.
“As Cuscal and Indue support critical business functions for their customers, many of them considered that the proposed acquisition will deliver efficiencies and support continued investment in products and innovation.”
Also important in the ACCC’s decision was the impact of broader industry trends on competition, including the increasing digitisation of payments that may lower the cost of switching between payment facilitation providers and reduce barriers to entry.

Background
Payment facilitation services enable organisations to offer payment solutions to other businesses or end consumers. Payment facilitation may include connection to one or more of the payment schemes (such as Visa, Mastercard, eftpos and BPAY), BIN sponsorship, card and ATM switching, and credit, debit and prepaid card processing, as well as data and fraud mitigation services and back-office support.
Customers of Cuscal and Indue include other financial institutions such as small or medium sized banks, credit unions, corporates, government agencies that issue payment cards and fintech companies which provide specialised financial products.
The legal test which the ACCC applies is in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which prohibits acquisitions that are likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.

Mergers and acquisitions
The ACCC has decided to oppose MicroStar Logistics LLC’s (MicroStar) proposed acquisition of the assets of Konvoy Holdings Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Konvoy), both of which supply keg pooling services to brewers across Australia.
MicroStar, which operates under the name Kegstar in Australia, and Konvoy are the only suppliers of keg pooling services, which enable brewers to rent kegs on a short-term basis to supply alcoholic drinks on tap to licensed venues.
“Our investigation has found that MicroStar acquiring the assets of Konvoy, the only other provider of keg pooling services in Australia, would be likely to substantially lessen competition,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
While independent brewers can use their own kegs or leased kegs, the ACCC considers that these options generally serve different purposes and would not be a viable alternative should keg pooling prices increase.
For example, owning kegs or renting them under long-term leases may be suitable when independent brewers are located close to the licensed venues, but these models are unlikely to be viable when servicing venues located further away.
“Without competitors, MicroStar could increase prices above a competitive level and reduce services or quality of service for customers,” Dr Williams said.
“Higher prices for keg pooling would have a significant impact on many independent brewers.”
The ACCC noted that Konvoy is in receivership and that its assets may ultimately be liquidated.
“Our view is that if the proposed acquisition does not proceed, the Konvoy business is likely to continue, whether under new or existing ownership; however, we recognise that liquidation of the assets is also a potential outcome,” Dr Williams said.
“If Konvoy’s assets are liquidated, they would likely remain in the market and be available to new or emerging rivals to MicroStar, or to independent brewers.”
More information can be found on the ACCC public register:
MicroStar Logistics, LLC - Konvoy Holdings Pty Limited.
Background
MicroStar is the largest independent keg services company in the United States with operations in the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. It entered the Australian market in 2021 via the acquisition of the Kegstar business from Brambles.
In Australia, Kegstar handles the activities and costs relating to a brewery’s keg use (for example, keg capital costs, reverse logistics, repair and maintenance, and keg management labour) under a pay-per-fill (PPF) model.
Under the PPF model, a brewery will order the number of kegs it requires, these are then delivered to the brewery for them to clean, fill and ship to the brewery’s customers. The brewery provides information on full keg deliveries to Kegstar who then tracks the kegs to the brewery’s customers (i.e. licensed venues), and then Kegstar arranges to collect the empty kegs for further use by its PPF customers. Brewers will pay for this PPF service based on the number of kegs that the brewery refills.
Konvoy operates a keg services business in Australia where it provides keg rentals on a short-term basis, known as “keg pooling”; and it leases kegs on a long-term basis, for a period of 12-60 months, known as “keg leasing”. Under its long-term keg leasing, brewers can lease kegs for their brewery for a monthly fee.
For its keg pooling, Konvoy stores and maintains a fleet of serviced kegs which are delivered to brewers as needed in exchange for a fixed fee. The brewers will then clean, fill and distribute the kegs. Konvoy tracks the kegs and arranges a pickup from the brewer’s customers, usually licensed venues, once they are empty.
In addition to these leasing services, Konvoy offers separate keg maintenance and repair and branding services. It also sells kegs to customers and supplies a tracking technology, known as ‘Katch’, as part of its logistics offering which assists with tracking kegs across the supply chain.
Konvoy entered receivership and administration on 11 March 2025. The Receivers determined that a sales process for Konvoy’s assets would provide the best return to creditors.

APRA proposes more accessible pathway to IRB accreditation for banks
Thursday 23 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has proposed a simpler, clearer and more streamlined pathway for banks to become accredited to use the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to calculating credit risk-weighted assets.
The IRB method is one of two approaches banks can use to calculate risk-weighted assets, which determines the amount of regulatory capital they need to hold for credit risk.
1
While the vast majority of banks use the standardised approach, APRA has approved six of the largest banks to use the IRB approach.
2
The IRB approach can provide a small financial benefit to banks by marginally reducing their capital requirements. However, accreditation to use the IRB approach requires banks to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in their risk management practices that has historically been too resource-intensive for most banks to achieve.
Noting that some medium-sized banks have expressed interest in obtaining IRB accreditation, APRA is seeking to make the pathway to IRB accreditation more accessible for these banks. This was one of the commitments APRA made as part of the recent
Council of Financial Regulators’ and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Review into Small and Medium-sized Banks
.
In a consultation paper released today, APRA has proposed a range of changes to the IRB accreditation pathway designed to help more banks access the IRB approach.
APRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said the proposed changes are further evidence of APRA’s commitment to “getting the balance right” in its regulatory settings.
“Capital is the cornerstone of every bank’s financial resilience so it’s essential banks can accurately align their capital requirements with the risks they face.
“For most banks, the simpler and more conservative standardised approach to calculating risk weighted assets is the most cost-effective way for them to do this. But we recognise that a cohort of mid-sized banks have told us that gaining IRB accreditation would help them compete more effectively with the largest banks, especially for home loans.
“While we don’t intend to drop our standards, the changes we are proposing today would improve the flexibility and transparency of the accreditation process, thereby supporting banks to more confidently plan, invest and transition, should they wish to,” Ms McCarthy Hockey said.
A consultation paper outlining the proposed changes is available here:

APRA refines proposals to facilitate easier access to alternative reinsurance arrangements
Wednesday 22 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has released a response paper outlining refinements to its proposed updates to the general insurance reinsurance framework. The changes aim to facilitate easier access to different forms of reinsurance, including alternative arrangements like insurance-linked securities, while continuing to safeguard policyholder interests.
The paper addresses industry feedback and outlines APRA’s revised approach, building on proposals from a
consultation
that commenced in November 2024.
The initiative is part of APRA’s objective “getting the regulatory balance right”, which means to promote financial system safety and stability in an efficient way. It reflects a commitment to support a resilient and adaptable insurance sector by balancing the protection provided by APRA’s capital settings with the risks, while enabling flexibility and innovation.
Industry feedback on draft prudential standards, prudential guidance, and reporting standards is invited by 30 January 2026.
The response paper is available on the APRA website at:
​Targeted adjustments to the general insurance reinsurance framework

Deputy Chair Margaret Cole - Remarks to the FSC Innovation in Retirement conference
Thursday 16 October 2025

It’s a pleasure to be here and to have this opportunity to discuss APRA’s priorities for superannuation as the industry transitions to the retirement phase.
This is one of my first public speaking engagements since the announcement of my decision to leave APRA by the end of my term in June next year. It has been, and continues to be, a privilege to oversee the industry at such a critical stage of its history.
The superannuation industry is in a state of change driven by three powerful forces.
The first, and the basis of many discussions at this forum today, is the ageing of the population and the implications that has for trustees and their members.
Treasury has previously estimated that around 2.5 million Australians will transition from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase in this decade.
How trustees respond to the challenge of supporting a sharply higher number of members in retirement will be a true test of the system.
The second is the continued strong growth in superannuation assets. The system now has $4.3 trillion in assets, of which $3 trillion are held in APRA-regulated funds.
That makes it the fourth largest pension system in the world behind that of the US, Canada and the UK, and, by some estimates, is on track to become the second largest by 2040. The expanding asset pool adds complexity for trustees in how they manage, invest, spend and safeguard their members’ monies.
The third force is superannuation’s increasing significance to the broader financial system. The potential risks to financial stability arising from the increased interconnectedness of banking and superannuation are important to understand. We expect to publish the early findings from APRA’s inaugural system stress test, which evaluated those risks, later this year.
When you factor in geopolitical instability, the rise in cyberattacks and fraud, as well as the growth in artificial intelligence, trustees have an extremely complex and fast-evolving operating environment to navigate.
Before I delve into the detail of APRA’s priorities for super, it’s worth reflecting: where did this large complex system, which has become so important to the financial wellbeing of Australians in retirement, first begin?
The introduction of the superannuation guarantee in 1992 was critical to the creation and rapid expansion of the universal compulsory superannuation system that we have today. However, the first employer-funded pension scheme came into being a full century and a half earlier.
In 1842 the local directors of the fledging Australasian Bank wanted to find a way to retain their bank officers. So, they came up with the idea – and their UK-based proprietors agreed – to launch a bank-funded pension scheme.
The scheme was formally approved at an annual meeting held in London in June of that year, with the first report of the meeting hitting the headlines of the Sydney Morning Herald
1
some four months later, such being the pace of international news at the time.
To quote from the Herald article dated 8th of October 1842:
“It appeared to the directors that the most effectual way of retaining the services of their officers would be to create a fund out of which pensions should be granted to those who, from age or length of meritorious service, or physical incapacity, might establish a claim to such a provision.”
But it is what follows that I found of particular interest. The meeting report goes on to say – and, again, I quote:
“It will be some years before a claim can arise to form a charge on this fund, and when that period approaches the directors will be prepared with a digested plan for its application.”
In case of doubt let me assure you such a “we’ll worry about it later” approach would not hold much water with APRA today.
Nor would it align with the spirit of the Retirement Income Covenant, which is central to one of APRA’s core strategic objectives: improved outcomes for superannuation members.
The Retirement Income Covenant – a case for urgency
The introduction of the Retirement Income Covenant more than three years ago represented a major nudge for the super industry.
While the accumulation phase of superannuation continued to require trustees’ strong focus, it was critical that the industry should pay greater attention to supporting the needs of members in or approaching retirement.
A core obligation under the covenant is for trustees to develop and implement retirement income strategies. But a year after the covenant came into effect, an APRA and ASIC joint thematic review identified a lack of urgency by trustees to meet their obligations.
While we have seen progress and improvements since then, there is a clear and growing gap between trustees who are meeting baseline expectations and those who have embraced retirement as a strategic and competitive imperative.
The case for having robust retirement income strategies is pressing. Our data shows that one in five funds have more than half of their members in or approaching retirement. However, over the next 20 years, this is expected to rise to around two in five funds.
The initial thematic review was followed by an APRA-ASIC pulse check survey last year, which explored the progress trustees were making to implement the recommendations arising from the review.
Yet again, we were concerned to find a lack of progress, this time in the tracking and measuring the success of retirement income strategies, despite this being a core recommendation.
Our latest joint pulse check was conducted earlier this year. How much progress has been made, and where there is still room for improvement, will be outlined in the survey findings, due for release next month.
Meeting members needs
Understanding the needs of members, and tailoring support to help them balance the objectives of maximising income, managing risks, and flexible access, lies at the heart of the covenant. This includes providing access to quality information to support member decision-making at the point of retirement.
While some funds are doing a good job at this, we believe there are still many members who could benefit from greater access to easy-to-understand information about the products, services and choices available to them.
Our data suggests that large numbers of retirement-age members remain in accumulation phase products paying tax where, depending on their personal circumstances, they are likely to be better off in the tax-free retirement phase. For example, $99 billion of assets in MySuper accounts are held in the accounts of members aged 65 or over.
In terms of products, APRA is doing its part to support greater product innovation in meeting the specific and various needs of members.
APRA recently consulted with the life insurance industry on proposals to reduce capital requirements for insurers offering annuity products. APRA’s aim is to lower the cost to life insurers of providing annuity products, helping to attract participants and support growth in the market, so that more members can consider this type of product where suitable for their individual circumstances. APRA will commence a second consultation on these reforms shortly and aims to finalise the proposed changes in the first half of next year.
The bigger picture
The oncoming wave of members entering retirement will bring a substantial increase in assets in the retirement phase of super. Our latest estimates are that assets in retirement products will swell from $575 billion to around $3 trillion in 20 years’ time.
Trustees will need to be prepared to manage the significant risk that this represents: Cyber risk, operational risk, investment risk, liquidity risk immediately spring to mind.
The credential stuffing cyberattacks that targeted individual superannuation members at several different funds earlier year were contained. But their occurrence exposed persistent weaknesses in authentication practices across the industry. They also indicated that the super system was in the sights of threat actors.
Unlike members in the accumulation phase, those in retirement can access their super savings which increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks, scams and fraud. A continuing priority for APRA is to ensure that regulated entities have robust information controls in place, including – but not limited to - multi factor authentication for member accounts.
For me, the urgency for planning and action on cyber protections was further emphasised this week by the Australian Signals Directorate. As reported in the media, the directorate has warned that developments in quantum computing could break the encryption used to protect passwords within five years. It’s a sobering thought.
Given the growing reliance on third parties, rapid technological advancements and geopolitical uncertainty, effective implementation of APRA’s operational risk management standard CPS 230 – particularly those requirements relating to oversight of material service providers – is critical to maintaining financial safety and stability. We will continue to engage with trustees to ensure they are meeting their new obligations.
With more assets to invest, trustees are increasingly looking to overseas investment options as well as private unlisted assets to drive returns for members. Increased overseas deployment heightens, among other things, currency risk and increased investment in unlisted assets raises questions about the management of liquidity risk and fair valuation.
Transparency
Greater industry transparency will further improve outcomes for members. APRA is committed to increasing transparency of retirement product performance and the industry’s progress in implementing the Retirement Income Covenant.
We now publish fund-level data on retirement product investment returns and investment strategies. APRA will integrate this data into our Comprehensive Product Performance Package from the second half of 2025-26. This will provide a more comprehensive view of product performance across the superannuation sector.
APRA is also working with Treasury to design a new reporting framework on retirement outcomes, which will commence in 2027. This initiative will enable monitoring of the outcomes delivered to members in retirement in a consistent and transparent way. The next step with the Retirement Reporting Framework is for Government to confirm the scope of the framework, following the consultation undertaken by Treasury earlier this year.
Getting the balance right
Avid readers of APRA’s Corporate Plan
2
will be aware that we added a new strategic objective this year – Getting the Balance Right.
This is about our need to balance our financial safety and stability objectives with competition and efficiency considerations.
Under that objective we are progressing nine actions to minimise regulatory burden.
In addition to the reduction of capital requirements for annuity products which I mentioned earlier, the initiatives include introducing further proportionality, removing unnecessary or duplicative rules, and strengthening data sharing with other agencies.
The world is watching
The push to improve financial outcomes for fund members in retirement is not unique to Australia.
Many jurisdictions around the world are focused on retirement funding for their own ageing populations.
But what does set our system apart from many others is the maturity of our compulsory defined contribution system which supports a constant flow of new capital into the superannuation system.
The UK, which has previously relied to a greater extent in recent years on a defined benefit system, is transitioning towards a defined contributions model. The development of the UK’s Value for Money framework for defined contribution pension funds, has taken into account Australia’s approach and experience.
The strong interest in our system was also evident in my recent meetings with UK pension authorities and regulators and at last month’s International Organisation of Pension Regulators sessions.
Conclusion
In closing, Australia’s superannuation system is, in many respects, the envy of the world.
But we know it’s not perfect.
It introduces complexity at a time in members’ lives when they don’t want complexity.
To keep superannuation a world class system, trustees need to respond to the challenges arising from the three powerful drivers of change that are shaping the industry.
That means doing more to improve outcomes for members in retirement.
Doing more to build operational resilience as the system continues to expand.
And doing more to understand the systemic significance of superannuation, not just at a fund level, but in the context of the broader financial system.
Trustees must be equipped and capable to meet the challenges – both risks and opportunities lie ahead.
Thank you

APRA releases latest Points of Presence Statistics for authorised deposit-taking institutions
Thursday 16 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has released its 2025 authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) Points of Presence Statistics.
The Points of Presence Statistics are a detailed listing of the physical banking service channels provided to Australians, including branches, ATMs and EFTPOS facilities. As the national data collection agency for the financial sector, APRA collects points of presence information from ADIs and publishes it annually.
The latest statistics show the ongoing trend of a decline in physical points of presence over the last year, albeit at a slower rate than previous years. The number of bank branches nationwide fell 4.6 per cent between June 2024 and June 2025. Regional and remote areas experienced the smallest fall recorded since this data series began (1.9 per cent), due in part to a moratorium on regional branch closures agreed between the Government and major banks in February this year.
These statistics do not cover the entirety of banking service channels. Trends in physical banking service channels provided by ADIs should be considered in the broader context of increased usage of digital banking services and the presence of other service providers. APRA encourages industry bodies to work together to provide increased transparency on this matter. For example, as the industry association for the payments system, the Australian Payments Network publishes data on ATMs, including those operated by third parties.
APRA has also concluded its review of Points of Presence data for ADIs. Further details are available in APRA’s
response letter
.

APRA confirms Westpac has met the obligations of the Court Enforceable Undertaking
Wednesday 15 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has determined that Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac) has completed a multi-year risk transformation program required by APRA and, consequently, APRA will remove the remaining $500 million capital add-on applied to Westpac.
Following an APRA investigation in 2020, Westpac entered a
Court Enforceable Undertaking
(CEU) with APRA in December 2020 where it committed to remediating specific prudential weaknesses identified by APRA in its culture, governance and accountability, and address the root causes of these issues. In response, Westpac established the Customer Outcomes and Risk Excellence (CORE) Program and appointed an independent reviewer.
Prior to this, APRA had pre-emptively imposed a
$500 million capital add-on
on Westpac in July 2019 and an
additional $500 million capital add-on
in December 2019.
As APRA progressed its supervision program, a first tranche of
$500 million capital add-on
was removed in July 2024 in recognition of Westpac’s progress in addressing these issues. APRA indicated at the time that the remainder would stay in place until Westpac completed its transition work and APRA undertook further validation work to assess the sustainability of improvements made in prudent risk management practices and outcomes.
Satisfied that this program is complete, and the specific prudential issues identified by APRA have been addressed, APRA has removed the remaining tranche of $500 million capital add-on, with immediate effect.
APRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said: “As a systemically important bank, APRA expects Westpac to hold itself to the requisite standard of prudent risk management and governance practices. Completion of this risk transformation program is a vital step in ensuring these expectations are consistently met. Our experience has shown us that effective risk transformation programs may continue to identify legacy issues, and we expect Westpac to maintain its unquestionably strong capital position”.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has released its Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) for the period October 2025 to September 2027. This is APRA’s second Innovate RAP and third RAP since 2017.
The latest Reconciliation Action Plan builds on APRA’s previous commitments and focuses on four key themes:
Creating a working environment that increasingly attracts, retains and develops Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees.
Broadening the impact of our RAP activities throughout APRA’s five offices across Australia and forming local cultural connections.
Developing opportunities for more APRA employees to engage personally with First Nations people and cultures, growing their cultural awareness and contributing to reconciliation more directly in the broader Australian community.
Further exploring APRA’s specific role to promote reconciliation within its sphere of influence - in partnership with other financial regulators - in a way that aligns with APRA’s mandate.
The actions outlined in the RAP are designed to complement APRA’s inclusion and diversity (I&D) strategy and advance reconciliation within APRA.

APRA Executive Board Member Suzanne Smith - Remarks to the ICA conference 2025

From risk to resilience: Futureproofing Australia’s insurance sector
Introduction
Good morning and thank you for the invitation. It's a pleasure to return to the ICA conference for my third address.
I’m pleased to be here with my ASIC colleague, Commissioner Alan Kirkland.
The theme of futureproofing Australia in a risky world is highly relevant. Who better to manage the challenges of a risky and ever-evolving world than those who live and breathe risk every day? Insurers.
Risks are on the rise, with businesses facing geopolitical instability, cyber threats and a changing climate. Despite these evolving challenges, communities continue to expect that insurers get the basics right. Each claim filed tests how well those expectations are met. Enhancing consumer understanding of policies is vital, or diminishing trust could undermine the social licence of insurers.
So, it is important that you take the time to ask yourself what is within your control to ensure that those expectations are met, and how you will hold yourself and others accountable to deliver on those promises?
The conference themes of resilience, innovation and leadership are a great starting point to challenge yourselves on how you do that. Today, I will have a look at each of these three industry pillars.
Resilience: get the basics right, every day
Let’s start with resilience. It’s the heartbeat of insurance – helping communities recover from disastrous events, giving investors confidence and boosting communities’ financial and social resilience.
We acknowledge there are many factors that sit outside of the control of insurers alone. Climate change, the need for de-risking, mitigation and addressing cost-of-living pressures rely on a suite of actors including government, the community and other businesses to effect change.
However, you are in control when it comes to how you run your business, manage your risks, treat your customers, innovate your products and, ultimately, build trust and resilience in your industry.  In the past year, the industry has taken positive steps to strengthen resilience through better disaster planning, and commencing work on implementing commitments made in the Industry Action Plan in response to the 2022 Flood Inquiry.
While this work is strengthening the core of your business, note resilience isn’t a ”one and done” exercise, it’s a constant practice of adaptation.
And true resilience rests on solid fundamentals, including, but not limited to:
a strong capital base that’s supported by prudent underwriting and effective risk management;
operational resilience, including third-party oversight and planning for major risk events;
robust and sound claims management capabilities, processes and controls; and
cyber security that keeps pace with evolving threats.
Getting the basics right is non-negotiable. APRA will continue to push you in these areas, but we hope to see insurers proactively holding themselves accountable to ensure their basics are strong.
The implementation of the Financial Accountability Regime in March this year has further increased accountability. Under FAR, insurers must have appointed accountable persons to take responsibility for key insurance functions in areas including capital management, risk management, underwriting, reinsurance and product design.
Embracing innovation
Let’s look at innovation: It isn’t optional – it’s essential. It’s how we futureproof insurance and support a thriving, competitive industry. By embracing effective design and implementation, innovation can improve customer engagement at various touchpoints, while also delivering cost efficiencies that can assist with affordability pressures. Innovations can also make it easier to identify and respond to risks.
The risks we face today – cyber, climate, geopolitical – demand smarter and faster responses. Investment in digital capabilities, AI, and new business strategies will open new opportunities and enhance industry resilience.
AI shows considerable potential in areas such as underwriting, claims processes, cybersecurity, fraud detection, and crisis prevention. It can bring efficiency to your business and in turn deliver greater value to your customers. However, it’s imperative that you fully understand the risks, as well as the opportunities.
While I encourage you to embrace innovation, I have one reminder: solve for the customer – and do this transparently.  What more can you do to help your customer understand why their premium has changed, the factors that contribute to an increasing price and importantly what role, if any they can play to bring the cost down? Transparency builds trust – and trust builds your business.
Leadership: step up – together
That brings us to leadership. In a risky world, leadership means courage and clarity.
Good leadership creates resilience. It shapes a strong risk culture.
APRA’s latest “Insurance Sector Risk Culture Survey” shows what "good" practice looks like:
Boards that drive real change, executives who challenge constructively and staff who feel safe to speak up.
Clear roles and accountability, including proper recognition and support for risk raisers.
And a risk culture that’s embraced across the organisation. From leaders to middle managers, and from back office to frontline teams.
This survey also unearthed pain points for claims and technology staff – areas that need urgent uplift.
The insights from this survey will help you to understand your business and step ahead of your risks. Insurers who address these issues promptly can significantly enhance their competitive position.
APRA: getting the balance right
Accountability is not just something APRA expects from the entities we regulate. It is something we constantly challenge ourselves on. We publicly outline our strategic priorities each year in our Corporate Plan – most recently in August.
In addition to strengthening our focus on aspects like cyber and operational resilience, the latest plan sharpens APRA’s focus on “getting the balance right”. This means promoting system safety and stability in a balanced and efficient way.
APRA is progressing a range of initiatives to minimise regulatory burden for the industry to support productivity. While we have a prudential framework in place that is designed to minimise unnecessary burden, we will further promote efficiency, transparency, and proportional regulation where it’s safe to do so. For the general insurance sector, areas of focus include:
the adjustments of reinsurance settings to promote cost-effective access;
the ongoing review of data collections; and
the identification of data sharing opportunities with other government agencies to minimise complexity and duplication.
Over the coming months, APRA will engage with industry stakeholders to gather feedback on how to strike the optimal regulatory balance.
Sharing examples of duplicative or overly complex requirements will help us improve. I look forward to your insights.
Into the future
Futureproofing fundamentally means anticipating challenges and identifying strategies to mitigate shocks. While APRA does not expect the industry to foresee every possible emerging risk, public expectations for fair treatment remain constant. And, regardless of external difficulties, the requirement that insurers get the basics right will not abate.
Moreover, maintaining a social licence to operate relies on insurers’ accountability in making decisions that foster trust within the sector.
If you master the basics, embrace innovation, and lead with a strong risk culture, you won’t just weather the next storm - you’ll strengthen trust in an industry that is essential to the community and our economy.
Yes, the future is risky. But it’s also full of opportunity. Let’s make sure Australia is prepared.
Thank you. I’m looking forward to the conversation.

Mergers and acquisitions
The ACCC has outlined its preliminary competition concerns with Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd’s proposed acquisition of Telwater Pty Ltd in a Statement of Issues published today.
Telwater is the largest manufacturer and supplier of aluminium trailer boats in Australia and has strong brand recognition throughout the recreational marine industry. Market participants have told the ACCC that a Telwater aluminium trailer boat is a very important product for many dealers.
Yamaha is a leading supplier of outboard motors. It faces competition from outboard motor brands such as Mercury and Suzuki.
The ACCC’s preliminary view is that the proposed acquisition is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the wholesale supply of outboard motors in Australia.
“We are concerned that, following the acquisition, Yamaha would have the ability and incentive to link the wholesale supply of Yamaha outboard motors to Telwater aluminium trailer boats, for example, by requiring dealers of Telwater boats to also become Yamaha outboard motor dealers,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
“This acquisition could make it much harder for other outboard motor suppliers to compete effectively with Yamaha, ultimately reducing the choice and competitive offerings available to consumers.”
The ACCC is also concerned that the merged entity could seek to reduce the access to dealers and customers by rival suppliers of trailer boats.
“Linking the wholesale supply of Yamaha outboard motors with Telwater aluminium trailer boats could limit how effectively existing and future rival wholesale suppliers of aluminium boats and outboard motors can compete post-merger,” Dr Williams said.
“This could ultimately lead to higher prices and reduced choice or quality for consumers seeking to purchase a new aluminium trailer boat or outboard motor.”
The ACCC invites submissions from interested parties in response to the Statement of Issues by 23 October 2025.

Notes to editors
‘Outboard motors’ are standalone systems that are installed to the outside hull of the boat, as opposed to inboard motors which are installed inside the boat’s hull and used for larger boats.
Trailer boats are small marine vessels that can be fitted to a trailer for easy transportation and generally range between 2 – 9 metres in length. Trailer boats can be made from various materials, with the most common being aluminium or fibreglass.
Aluminium boats are primarily used for recreational boating in Australia. Aluminium boats are generally lighter, more durable and generally less expensive than fibreglass boats.
Aluminium boats and outboard motors are complementary products, often purchased by consumers together. The complementary nature of these products is highly relevant to the ACCC’s competition assessment.
More information on how the ACCC considers conglomerate effects can be found in section 4 of the
ACCC’s Merger Assessment Guidelines
.
Background
Yamaha is proposing to acquire 100 per cent of the shares of Telwater from Bombardier Recreation Products Inc (BRP), alongside a property in Coomera, Queensland used to manufacture, fit and warehouse aluminium trailer boats.
Trailer boats are generally used for leisure activities, such as fishing and cruising. Recreational trailer boats typically use an outboard motor.
Yamaha Motor Company Ltd (YMC) manufactures outboard motors in Asia, primarily in Japan, and imports them into Australia by its wholly owned subsidiary, Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd (Yamaha). Yamaha supplies the outboard motors to dealers (retailers) Australia wide. Dealers then supply the outboard motors to end-customers.
Yamaha does not manufacture boats in Australia. YMC subsidiaries manufacture trailer boats overseas for various international markets. Yamaha and a related business have supplied a small number of these trailer boats to dealers in Australia, primarily via a third party Australian distributor. Yamaha also owns the trademarks for a small number of aluminium trailer boat and trailer brands, which were previously licensed to a third party manufacturer and are not currently in use. Yamaha does not supply trailers for boats in Australia.
Telwater manufactures aluminium trailer boats and trailers in Australia and supplies them to dealers, who then sell to end customers. Telwater currently supplies three lines of trailer boats: Quintrex, Stacer and Yellowfin branded boats.
Telwater supplies custom-fitted trailers that are sold together with its boats (branded under Telwater), or loose trailers (under the brand name “Move”) that can be used for any trailer boat. Telwater also supplies a limited number of outboard motors to dealers as part of a package with a Telwater boat and also potentially a trailer. Telwater is a non-exclusive distributor of Mercury outboard motors, with Mercury also supplying its outboard motors to dealers itself and via other wholesalers. Telwater also supplies a very small number of Rotax outboard motors (which are manufactured and distributed by BRP), as part of a package with some of its boats.

Opening Statement to Senate Economics Legislation Committee – October 2025
Thursday 9 October 2025

John Lonsdale, Chair - Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.
I’d like to begin by acknowledging the new members of this Committee, particularly Chair Senator Darmanin and Deputy Chair Senator Hume. APRA looks forward to continuing to work with the Committee throughout this Parliamentary term.
I’m pleased to confirm to the committee that Australia has a stable and safe financial system, benefiting from prudential regulation and policy settings reviewed and enhanced over many years. The importance of a stable financial system cannot be underestimated at a time of such global uncertainty.
Appearances before parliamentary committees such as this are one of the key mechanisms through which APRA remains accountable to the parliament and the Australian people. Another is our Annual Report, which we tabled to parliament last week.
Our 2024-25
Annual Report
details how APRA continues to deliver on its core purpose of maintaining the resilience and stability of banks, insurers and superannuation trustees. The past 12 months have been marked by ongoing geopolitical volatility and cyber threats. Despite these challenges, APRA’s Annual Report confirms that our banks have “unquestionably strong” levels of capital to protect deposits and support lending; insurers retain the financial strength to pay claims from policyholders; and the superannuation industry continues to deliver robust returns for members, while also making headway in improving retirement outcomes.
APRA’s forward-looking roadmap for fulfilling our mandate is outlined in our
Corporate Plan
, published in August, which outlines our policy, supervision, resolution and data priorities.
As always, our latest plan has a strong focus on maintaining the financial and operational resilience of the financial system and responding to significant and emerging risks.
This year our Corporate Plan elevates “getting the balance right” as a strategic priority. While APRA’s prudential framework has always been proportionate, as required by our mandate, we are sharpening our focus to ensure our regulation remains right-sized and efficient – and therefore supportive of competition and productivity in the economy.
So far, APRA has announced nine initiatives to increase proportionality and reduce regulatory burden. In banking, these include streamlining our bank licensing process and formalising a three-tiered approach to proportionality. Other commitments include promoting access to cost-effective reinsurance in general insurance, reducing life insurers’ capital requirements for annuities, and removing duplicative or unnecessary requirements, especially in data reporting.
Our Corporate Plan also outlines how we are intensifying scrutiny of superannuation fund expenditure and reviewing the investment governance of major platform providers.
To that end, APRA wrote to trustees this week requiring them to accelerate and escalate efforts to safeguard member investments held in platform products after an APRA review found some weak practices in relation to onboarding and monitoring of platform products. Based on the findings of this review, APRA will provide each in-scope Platform Trustee with an individual assessment letter bilaterally and escalate supervisory intensity as required.
We have also published insights into the challenges facing some superannuation trustees in operational efficiency, growth and competitive positioning and emphasised to Trustees the importance of considering these challenges as part of their strategic and business planning.
Another top priority in the months ahead is finalising reforms to our cross-industry framework for governance. This is a significant piece of work; well-governed institutions are likely to be more resilient in times of stress, while poor governance can create weakness that leads to misconduct, losses and failures. We have had more submissions to this consultation than any other in recent memory. We will provide an interim update on the consultation shortly.
In July, we announced we were keeping our macroprudential policy settings, including the mortgage serviceability buffer, on hold. Housing credit continues to grow at sound levels and continue to flow to different borrower segments, including to first-home buyers. Even though inflation and interest rates are lower, we are mindful of ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Further, lower interest rates have historically led to higher credit growth and leverage, higher house prices and often more risky lending. As a result, we are engaging with banks on implementation aspects of different macroprudential tools to manage lending risks, which may include limits on new high debt-to-income lending, or limits on new investor or interest-only loans.
We also intend to further strengthen cyber resilience across all APRA’s regulated industries given the recent escalation of attacks. We were reminded of this threat earlier this year when several major superannuation funds were the target of credential stuffing attacks.
Closely related to cyber security is operational resilience. In July, APRA’s new prudential standard on operational risk management, CPS 230, came into effect. This standard is aimed at ensuring banks, insurers and superannuation trustees can respond to business disruptions that may impact their delivery of essential financial services to the community, particularly in relation to their use of service providers.
Another key initiative will be the publication in coming months of the results of our inaugural System Stress Test, designed to evaluate interconnectedness between the banking and superannuation sectors.
Before wrapping up, I would like to acknowledge the recent announcement of APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole’s decision to leave APRA by the end of her current term next year. Margaret has made a great contribution to APRA since joining us in 2021. Margaret has strengthened our legal and enforcement functions and helped reshape processes to make APRA a more efficient regulator.
With that, my APRA colleagues are happy to take your questions.

APRA disqualifies two directors of Xinja Bank under Financial Accountability Regime
Thursday 9 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has disqualified the former CEO of Xinja Bank (Xinja) and one other director from being or acting as accountable persons of any authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI)
1
under the Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) for failing to comply with their accountability obligations.
Former CEO Eric Wilson has been disqualified for a period of eight years, while non-executive director Craig Swanger has been disqualified for 10 years. They are the first disqualifications under the FAR.
Xinja, now known as A.C.N. 618 937 054 Limited, is in liquidation after
returning deposits
and handing back its ADI licence to APRA in 2021.
The disqualifications follow an extensive investigation by APRA into the impact that “side agreements” between Xinja and some of its investors had on Xinja’s capital position during 2020 and whether APRA was misled in relation to the bank’s capital position. APRA’s investigation commenced in May 2021 and the disqualifications have been subject to review processes.
Between May and August 2020, Xinja entered into agreements with three investors purporting to raise CET1 capital. CET1 capital is considered the highest quality of capital because it does not result in any repayment or distribution obligations on an institution. Xinja represented to APRA that this capital was CET1 capital. However, the transactions involved Xinja entering into side agreements together with share subscription agreements with the investors. The side agreements contained additional terms that undermined the investments’ status as CET1 capital, in turn undermining APRA’s capital regime.
APRA determined the actions of Mr Wilson and Mr Swanger in relation to this matter breached the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which was superseded by the FAR in March last year.
APRA sets requirements on ADIs’ minimum capital to ensure they can absorb unexpected losses in their business and to support financial system stability. It is a key pillar of APRA’s “unquestionably strong” capital requirements for Australian ADIs. Complying with laws and regulations governing capital raising and reporting is a key responsibility of accountable persons of ADIs.
Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said the disqualifications demonstrate that APRA is willing to impose serious consequences on accountable persons who fail to comply with their obligations.
“An accurate understanding of banks’ capital adequacy framework is essential for APRA to protect depositors by ensuring banks have the financial resilience to withstand a crisis. It is vital that accountable entities and accountable persons are open and cooperative with APRA so that it may effectively discharge its responsibilities for overseeing the safety and soundness of Australia's financial system.
“These individuals failed to act in accordance with their duty to ensure Xinja had effective capital in place and to be open, constructive and cooperative with APRA in reporting Xinja’s capital position. These were serious failures and the disqualifications, which are the first under the FAR, reflect the gravity of this conduct.
“The FAR means greater accountability standards for regulated entities, their directors and senior executives, and tougher consequences for when they are not met. APRA recognises that the actions of directors and senior executives shape the conduct and operating culture of the entities they lead. Where accountable persons fall short, APRA will hold them to account,” Ms Cole said.
Craig Swanger
During 2020, Mr Swanger was a non-executive director and an accountable person of Xinja.
APRA found that Mr Swanger failed to comply with his accountability obligations as an accountable person by:
not acting with honesty and integrity, and not dealing with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way, where in response to a request by an external investigator appointed by APRA for documents relating to arrangements with three of Xinja’s investors, Mr Swanger altered documents which he knew would be provided by Xinja to investigators appointed by APRA. The impact of these alterations was to remove content that showed that capital raised by Xinja was incorrectly classified as CET1 capital. Providing all relevant documents unaltered would have put APRA on notice that there had been a change to the investment documents and allowed APRA to further consider how and why those changes had occurred;
not acting with integrity in his involvement in Xinja’s entry into the side agreements with investors where he knew the capital raised under them was not CET1 capital, but would be classified as CET1 capital, and caused the disguise and obscuring of the substance of the capital;
not acting with due skill, care and diligence in raising capital for Xinja that he knew or should have known could not be CET1 capital and did not take steps to stop the capital being erroneously classified and reported to APRA as CET1 capital, and did not satisfy himself that agreements with an investor that required APRA’s consent had been provided by Xinja to APRA; and
not taking reasonable steps to prevent matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential standing of Xinja where he knew Xinja had erroneously reported capital raised as CET1 capital, did not take steps to provide the side agreements to APRA nor ascertain whether capital raised was misrepresented to APRA and did not take steps to put in place adequate procedures to stop Xinja erroneously classifying funds as CET1 capital.
APRA has disqualified Mr Swanger for a period of 10 years.
Eric Wilson
During 2020, Mr Wilson was the CEO and an accountable person of Xinja.
APRA found that Mr Wilson failed to comply with his accountability obligations by:
not acting with due skill, care and diligence where Xinja raised capital that Mr Wilson knew or should have known could not be CET1 capital, which was misclassified and reported to APRA as CET1 capital, in circumstances where APRA was not informed of or provided with the side agreements relating to the capital raising. It would have been immediately apparent to Mr Wilson that there was a significant issue about whether capital raised in accordance with the side agreements could be classified as CET1 capital and he failed to take steps to stop the existence of the side agreements or stop the erroneous classification and reporting of CET1 capital;
not dealing with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way where APRA was not informed of the side agreements and in relation to concerns within Xinja of these side agreements’ impact on the capital that was raised. Mr Wilson knew or should have known of the impact of the side agreements on the status of Xinja’s CET1 capital and failed to advise APRA and/or failed to satisfy himself that APRA had been advised of this issue; and
not taking reasonable steps to prevent matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential standing of Xinja where he did not take steps to put in place adequate procedures to stop Xinja misclassifying the capital that was raised as CET1 capital.
APRA has disqualified Mr Wilson for a period of eight years. Mr Wilson’s relative disqualification period reflects that he did not breach his obligation to act with honesty and integrity under s 37CA(1)(a) of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth).

1
Mr Wilson and Mr Swanger are also disqualified from being an accountable person of an authorised non-operating holding company (NOHC) of an ADI, and any significant related entity of an ADI or NOHC of an ADI.

Mergers and acquisitions
Agriculture
The ACCC will not oppose Elders Limited’s (ASX: ELD) proposed acquisition of Delta Agribusiness after accepting a court-enforceable undertaking that commits Elders to divest six Delta stores in Western Australia.
Elders and Delta both supply rural merchandise such as agricultural chemicals, seed, fertiliser, animal health products and related services, such as agronomy services, through their retail networks. Both companies also supply rural merchandise at the wholesale level.
“Our review closely considered the likely effect of the proposed acquisition on competition in each local area where both Elders and Delta have a retail store, taking into account the specifics of each local area,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
"We examined the strength of competing retailers, the particular geographic features and size and type of farms, among other factors. We also engaged with a range of stakeholders including farmers, competing retailers, wholesale suppliers, buying groups and industry bodies as part of our review."
“The nature of competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise is more localised than is the case in other retail sectors, partly due to the differences in farming in different local areas, and the importance of local relationships,” Mr Keogh said.
“Following an in-depth review, we were concerned that the proposed acquisition would be likely to substantially lessen competition in several local areas in Western Australia.”
To address these concerns, Elders has undertaken to divest six Delta stores in Western Australia, and the ACCC has accepted their undertaking.
The ACCC considered, and has approved, Independent Rural Pty Ltd as the purchaser for Delta stores in Dalwallinu and Kalannie, and E. E. Muir & Sons Pty Limited (Muirs) as the purchaser for Delta stores in Albany, Hyden, Manypeaks and Wellstead.
“The ACCC considers that the undertaking provided by Elders addresses the competition concerns that would otherwise arise from the proposed acquisition. Independent Rural’s and Muirs’ acquisition of Delta stores in each of these local areas will create a strong, independent and viable long-term competitor to Elders in those six areas,” Mr Keogh said.
The ACCC concluded that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise in other local areas where both Elders and Delta own retail stores.
In its
Statement of Issues
, the ACCC also identified potential competition concerns in the retail supply of rural merchandise at a broader regional, state or national level, and in the wholesale supply of rural merchandise in Western Australia.
Having reviewed additional information and engaged in further market inquiries, the ACCC considers that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise at a broader regional, state or national level, or in the wholesale supply of rural merchandise in Western Australia.
“Ultimately, the ACCC did not consider that the proposed acquisition was likely to substantially lessen competition in any relevant market with the undertaking provided by Elders,” Mr Keogh said.
Further information, including the undertaking accepted by the ACCC, can be found on the ACCC’s public register at

Compliance and enforcement
Scam warning:
The ACCC is aware that scammers may call, email or text to falsely offer to help get compensation from various businesses. They may use this media release about compensation to convince people their contact is real.
STOP
– Don’t give money or personal information to anyone if you’re unsure. Scammers will create a sense of urgency. Don’t rush to act. Don’t click on links even if the message appears to come from Optus. Say ‘no’, hang up, delete.
CHECK
– Ask yourself could the call, email or text be fake? Scammers pretend to be from organisations and entities you know and trust. Contact the organisation using information you source independently, so that you can verify if it is real or not.
PROTECT
– Act quickly if something feels wrong. Contact your bank immediately if you lose money. If you have provided personal information call IDCARE on 1800 595 160. The more we talk the less power they have. Report scams to the National Anti-Scam Centre’s Scamwatch service at
scamwatch.gov.au
when you see them.
Telstra has been ordered by the Federal Court to pay a penalty of $18 million for breaching the Australian Consumer Law after it moved almost 9,000 Belong customers to a lower speed plan without telling them.
In October and November 2020, Telstra migrated 8,897 customers on its Belong brand NBN plans from their current plan which provided a maximum upload speed of 40 Mbps to a service that provided a maximum upload speed of only 20 Mbps. The download speed was unchanged at 100Mbps.
Telstra did not tell customers of the change in maximum upload speed in their service at the time of the change.
“The $18 million penalty sends a strong message to all businesses that they cannot mislead consumers by making changes to key aspects of a service without informing customers of those changes” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.
In addition to the penalty, all affected customers have, or will be, remediated by Telstra with a credit or payment of $15 for each month the customer had been on the lower upload speed plan.
The total remediation that Telstra will pay to affected customers exceeds $2.3 million.
“Telstra’s failure to inform customers that their broadband service had been changed denied them the opportunity to decide whether the changed service was suitable for their needs,” Ms Brakey said.
“Misleading pricing and claims in relation to essential services, with a particular focus on telecommunications, is one of ACCC’s current enforcement priorities.”
Telstra made payments to some affected customers prior to the ACCC commencing proceedings. The remaining payments to customers are being made in accordance with a
court-enforceable undertaking
Telstra has given to the ACCC. Those customers will be contacted by Belong via email.
The Court also ordered Telstra to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs. The Court will publish its reasons for judgment at a later date.
Telstra co-operated with the ACCC by making joint submissions to the Court about orders, including in relation to penalties.
Background
Belong was launched by Telstra in 2013 as a low-cost mobile and internet service provider, operating semi-independently in a number of areas, including products, marketing, service, billing and parts of IT.
Upload speed refers to the speed an individual’s internet connection can allow data to be sent from their devices to the internet e.g. sending emails, streaming video calls and conferences.
In May 2020, NBN Co launched a series of new wholesale consumer speed tiers, including a new 100/20Mbps wholesale speed tier, which provided a maximum download speed of 100mbps and a maximum upload speed of 20mbps. This speed tier costs retail service providers $7 less per month than the 100/40Mbps plan on a wholesale level.
The ACCC commenced its
court action
against Telstra on 6 December 2022, and the
Federal Court made findings against Telstra
on 21 February 2025.

Gas supply on Australia’s east coast is expected to improve in the first quarter of 2026, but the outlook still depends on how much uncontracted gas LNG producers decide to export, according to the
ACCC’s latest gas inquiry report
released today.
The report indicates a gas supply surplus of between 2 and 24 petajoules (PJ) is expected for the east coast, depending on what the LNG producers decide to do with their uncontracted gas.
“The Queensland LNG producers have reported a reduction in contracted LNG exports, and now expect to have 22 PJ of uncontracted gas available in the first quarter of next year,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.
“Given ongoing concerns about sufficiency of domestic gas supply, the ACCC will be monitoring whether and how this gas is offered to domestic buyers.”
“Despite the improvement, the supply-demand outlook remains tight in the southern states,” Ms Brakey said.
“For the first time, southern gas producers are not expecting to produce surplus gas in the first quarter of the year, when demand is usually at its lowest. This may create challenges for fully replenishing southern gas storage facilities ahead of winter 2026.”
Regional supply-demand outlook for quarter 1 2026 (PJ)
Source: ACCC analysis of data obtained from gas producers in July 2025 and of the domestic demand forecast (Step Change scenario) from AEMO, Gas Statement of Opportunities (GSOO), March 2025.
Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. The quantity required to meet long-term LNG SPAs includes feed gas requirements (such as fuel) required to produce LNG. LNG producers' uncontracted gas has been zeroed out when negative as this gas must be acquired from the domestic market, either as additional gas production, purchases or a reduction in exports which would have a net 0 impact on the forecast.
Gas suppliers and users have signed more long-term supply deals so far this year, for supply in 2026 and 2027.
But the report found, despite this, the total amount of gas secured under these contracts remains below levels seen before 2022. Most of the contracts are for only one year.
Prices offered by gas producers for 2026 supply eased in the first half of 2025, falling by an average of 2 per cent to $13.12 per gigajoule (GJ) compared to the second half of 2024. In comparison, prices offered by gas retailers for 2026 supply averaged $14.33/GJ.
For 2027, the average price under producer contracts was $13.93/GJ, while retailer contracts averaged $14.30/GJ. Suppliers contracted a total of 18 PJ of gas for 2026 supply, and 21 PJ for 2027.
Gas policy measures have not made a material difference for local users
The report also reviewed the impact of the Gas Market Code (Gas Code), the Commonwealth Heads of Agreement with LNG exporters (HoA) and the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM), following the ACCC’s initial observations reported in June 2025.
The ACCC has found these measures may have added some gas to the local market, but, overall, they have not materially improved outcomes for gas users.
“There are limits to what the gas policy measures can achieve on their own if the underlying causes of inadequate supply and ineffective competition are not addressed,” Ms Brakey said.
“In addition, they may also be having some unintended incentive effects and causing inefficiencies in gas supply negotiations.”
The ACCC’s review has found that the 2023 reforms to the ADGSM appear to have reduced LNG producers’ incentives to make a net contribution to the domestic market.
These changed incentives appear to have had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the risk of domestic supply shortfalls.
Further, since the 2022 HoA was entered into, the volumes of gas being offered and supplied by the LNG producers to the domestic market have declined over time, while LNG export volumes have increased.
The ACCC’s
submission
to the Gas Market Review outlines the ACCC’s experience and observations arising from the inquiry to inform government consideration of reforms to promote longer-term gas market efficiency and measures to ensure that, in the interim, the Code, ADGSM and HoA are fit for purpose.
Background
In 2017, the Australian Government directed the ACCC to conduct a
wide-ranging inquiry
to improve transparency of the gas market in Australia and support its efficient operation, and to monitor gas supply. On 29 August 2025 a
new direction
was made to formally extend the inquiry to 2030 and to establish quarterly reporting.
The ACCC’s next interim report is scheduled for December 2025

Scam warning:
The ACCC is aware that scammers may call, email or text to falsely offer to help get compensation from various businesses. They may use this media release about compensation to convince people their contact is real.
STOP
– Don’t give money or personal information to anyone if you’re unsure. Scammers will create a sense of urgency. Don’t rush to act. Don’t click on links even if the message appears to come from Optus. Say ‘no’, hang up, delete.
CHECK
– Ask yourself could the call, email or text be fake? Scammers pretend to be from organisations and entities you know and trust. Contact the organisation using information you source independently, so that you can verify if it is real or not.
PROTECT
– Act quickly if something feels wrong. Contact your bank immediately if you lose money. If you have provided personal information call IDCARE on 1800 595 160. The more we talk the less power they have. Report scams to the National Anti-Scam Centre’s Scamwatch service at
scamwatch.gov.au
when you see them.
Optus Mobile Pty Ltd (Optus) has today been ordered by the Federal Court to pay a penalty of $100 million for engaging in unconscionable conduct when selling mobile phones and contracts to hundreds of Australians, and subsequent debt collection in a case brought by the ACCC.
The Court has imposed this penalty after Optus admitted it acted unconscionably, in breach of the Australian Consumer Law, and agreed to make joint submissions with the ACCC to the Court that a total penalty of $100 million was appropriate.
In many instances the affected consumers did not want or need, could not use or could not afford the phones and contracts they were sold and, in some cases, consumers were pursued for debts resulting from these sales.
Many of the affected consumers were vulnerable or experiencing disadvantage, such as living with a mental disability, diminished cognitive capacity or learning difficulties, being financially dependent or unemployed, having limited financial literacy or English not being a first language. Many of the consumers were First Nations Australians from regional, remote and very remote parts of Australia.
“Optus’s conduct in this case was truly appalling, and we welcome the substantial penalty imposed by the Court and the deterrence message that it will send,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.
“During the course of our investigation we heard from many people who had not only experienced significant financial harm, but also emotional distress and fear after being pursued by debt collectors for long periods.”
“A company of Optus’s size should have had better systems and controls in place to identify and stop this sort of behaviour,” Ms Lowe said.
In his decision, Justice O’Sullivan said the consequences of Optus’s conduct were “profound”.
“Numerous individuals experienced severe financial harm, emotional distress, and social shame,” he said.
“Particularly damaging was the heightened risk of losing access to essential telecommunications services when faced with inflated service costs.”
In addition to the financial penalty, Optus has also provided the ACCC with a
five-year court-enforceable undertaking
that it will compensate impacted consumers and improve its internal systems.
Optus’s conduct impacted over 400 consumers and occurred at 16 Optus stores between August 2019 and July 2023. Any consumer who considers they may have been impacted by similar conduct should contact Optus.
Examples of the misconduct included:
putting undue pressure on consumers to purchase a large number of products, including expensive phones and accessories, that they did not want or need, could not use or could not afford;
failing to explain relevant terms and conditions to vulnerable consumers in a manner they could understand, resulting in them not understanding their ongoing payment obligations;
not having regard to whether consumers had Optus coverage where they lived;
selling products and services which Optus knew, or ought reasonably to have known, the consumers could not afford; and
misleading these consumers to believe that goods were free or included as part of a bundle at no additional cost.
Many impacted consumers were supported by local advocates, financial counsellors and carers in trying to seek a resolution with Optus.
“We commend the dedicated and hardworking people who assisted many of the affected consumers, and we also thank the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman for drawing the broader conduct to our attention,” Ms Lowe said.
In the case of Optus’s Mount Isa store, which has now closed, the telco pursued debts in circumstances where its then senior management knew that those debts related to contracts for goods and services that appeared to have been entered into at the Optus Mount Isa Store fraudulently and without consumer knowledge.
Optus’s then senior management became increasingly aware that Optus staff were engaging in the inappropriate sales practices and that Optus’s systems and controls could not stop the conduct. Optus acknowledged it failed to promptly take steps to fix deficiencies in its systems, which allowed the conduct to continue.
Commission-based sales arrangements for Optus’s sales staff had the clear potential to incentivise the inappropriate sales conduct, despite the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code requiring Optus, from 17 June 2022, to have regard to the
ACCC’s best practice recommendations
which recommend businesses avoid commission-based selling because of its potential to exacerbate the vulnerability of consumers.
This case follows similar ACCC action against Telstra, which was ordered in
May 2021
to pay a $50 million penalty for engaging in unconscionable conduct when it sold mobile contracts to 108 First Nations Australians consumers between at least 1 January 2016 and about 27 August 2018.
Examples of the alleged conduct
A First Nations consumer visited an Optus store in a metro area. They were sold multiple Optus mobile plans and services, including two mobile phones, as well as accessories. The Optus sales representative manipulated the credit check, which enabled them to sell the consumer Optus services and products that they could not afford. Despite the details of the sale coming to the attention of Optus’s fraud team, the consumer’s debt in excess of $3,000 was referred to an external debt collection agency. The debt continued to be pursued by Optus for over a year.
In a separate example, Optus entered into four contracts with a consumer who lived with deafness and communicated by Australian Sign Language. Optus staff failed to explain the terms of the consumer’s contract in a manner which they could understand. The consumer was on a disability pension, and the cost of the contracts was more than they could afford. In addition, the consumer did not need and could not use the Optus products and services. It was only with significant time and assistance of the consumer’s support worker that the consumer was able to cancel the contracts.
In 2019, an internal Optus investigation into customer accounts at the Optus store in Mount Isa resulted in a report that stated that the store manager had falsified identification documents and consumer information to create contracts for services, and had used the identities of First Nations consumers who were not aware that their identities had been used. Another report identified 82 contracts that appeared to have been fraudulently completed without consumer knowledge.
After Optus was notified of the conduct that was the subject of the reports, including its senior management at the time, it still referred and sold outstanding debts associated with some of those contracts to third party debt collection and factoring agencies. Some consumers whose identities were associated with the relevant customer accounts were subject to threats of legal proceedings being commenced against them and of reporting defaults to credit reporting bodies. Some customers continued to be pursued by third party collections agencies until as late as July 2024 and Optus had not taken steps to stop that occurring.
The ACCC acknowledges Optus’s cooperation in resolving the Court proceedings at an early stage and providing a court-enforceable undertaking. The undertaking includes:
a 3-year consumer remediation program
changes to remuneration and incentives for Optus sales staff designed to prevent further conduct from occurring
a requirement for Optus to ensure that certain Optus Licensee stores in the Northern Territory, regional Queensland and South Australia are directly operated by Optus
process and system changes, for example improvements to Optus’s complaints handling process for consumers experiencing vulnerability and/or disadvantage, and
a $1 million donation to an organisation facilitating digital literacy of First Nations Australians.
The Court also ordered Optus to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs, by consent.
Optus customer support
Consumers who think they may have been impacted by conduct similar to that
outlined in Optus’s undertaking
to the ACCC can call Optus’s specialist customer care team on 1300 082 820 for further information or support.
They can also visit the
Sales Misconduct Response page
on Optus’s website.
Background
Questions regarding the recent Optus outage affecting triple-0 call services are unrelated to this judgment and should be directed to the
Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA). The ACCC does not have a role in regulating or enforcing compliance with emergency call service regulations and other related rules.
Optus is Australia’s second largest telecommunications provider. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singtel Optus Pty Ltd, a foreign owned private company.
In Australia, Optus’s retail stores are either:
owned and operated directly by Optus RetailCo Pty Ltd; or
owned and operated through third party licensees, through Retail License Agreements. For example, prior to Optus buying back certain stores, all Optus stores in the Adelaide region were owned and operated by Mavaya Pty Ltd, and all Optus stores in the Northern Territory, as well as several in regional Queensland, were owned and operated by Suntel Communications Pty Ltd.
On 31 October 2024, the ACCC commenced
court action against Optus
. The investigation was prompted by a referral from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.
On 18 June 2025, the ACCC announced that
Optus had admitted
to engaging in unconscionable conduct and agreed to a total penalty of $100 million, subject to Court approval.

Compliance and enforcement
The ACCC has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against JustAnswer LLC for allegedly misleading consumers as to its affiliation with Australian Ombudsman or Government agencies and the cost of its online question and answer service, in breach of consumer laws.
It is alleged that from about 1 November 2022, JustAnswer made false or misleading representations via a chat widget on its website that consumers could use the online question and answer service for just AUD$2. However, in addition to paying the $2 joining fee, consumers were signed up to an ongoing subscription costing between around $50 and $90 per month.
The ACCC alleges that consumers were not adequately informed of the ongoing subscription fee and suffered financial harm as a result.
“Had consumers been aware that the total price of the JustAnswer online service cost at least 25 times more per month than the promoted joining fee, they may have chosen not to use it,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.
“Through its chat widget, JustAnswer offered to connect consumers to ‘experts’ in particular subject areas for a one-off fee of $2. The chat widget didn’t disclose any other charges, and the substantially higher ongoing monthly fee was not mentioned until consumers were directed to a payment screen.”
“The monthly subscription fee was shown in a way that we believe many consumers would not have seen,” Ms Lowe said.
“Manipulative online design practices which guide consumers to sign up for subscriptions they do not want or did not intend to buy can cause distress and financial loss.”
In addition to the alleged price misrepresentations, the ACCC alleges JustAnswer misled consumers by purporting that it or its services were sponsored or approved by, or otherwise affiliated with, the Fair Work Ombudsman, an Australian Ombudsman, or an Australian Government department.
“We consider some consumers may have engaged with JustAnswer on the mistaken belief that their questions would be answered by an independent ombudsman, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman,” Ms Lowe said.
“The ACCC commenced this investigation after receiving large numbers of complaints from consumers who claimed they were not aware of the ongoing subscription charges or who thought they were dealing with an Australian government body.”
The ACCC is seeking compensation orders for affected consumers, injunctions, civil pecuniary penalties, publication orders, and costs, as well as declarations that JustAnswer contravened consumer laws and the implementation of a compliance program.
Background
JustAnswer is registered and based in the United States and operates its business in 196 countries, with more than 700 employees.
It provides a service connecting consumers to subject matter ‘experts’ in areas such as medicine, law, accounting and technology, who are available to answer consumers’ questions. This service can be accessed via
JustAnswer’s website
or its Android/iOS app, the latter of which is not subject to allegations in this proceeding.
Consumers who use a search engine to find information on a particular topic may come across search results with links to JustAnswer’s website. This included search ads sponsored by JustAnswer.
In June, the ACCC published the tenth and final report of its
Digital Platform Services Inquiry
, which found consumers continue to face harms from unfair trading practices including manipulative design operations, such as using interfaces that direct consumers to more expensive subscriptions or purchase options, as well as undisclosed sponsorships and subscription traps. A subscription trap is when a business misleads a consumer into signing up for a subscription by representing that they are making a one-off purchase, or by making cancellation of a subscription difficult.
Consumer issues in the digital economy are one of the ACCC’s current enforcement priorities. This includes work in addressing unfair subscription-related practices, including subscription traps.

Release of Financial Stability Review – October 2025
Number
2025-29
Date
2 October 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) today released its October 2025
Financial
Stability Review
, providing
a comprehensive assessment of the health and resilience of Australia’s financial system.
The Review highlights that Australia’s financial system remains well positioned to navigate a period
of elevated global uncertainty.
The RBA views the largest risks to financial stability as coming from abroad:
High and rising government debt levels in major economies.
Stretched asset valuations and leverage in global markets.
Heightened geopolitical and operational risks.
However, the RBA finds that Australian households, businesses and banks are well placed to weather most
shocks:
Most households with mortgages are keeping up with repayments and have built savings buffers.
Many businesses have established financial buffers.
Australian banks continue to maintain high levels of capital and liquidity, positioning them to
support the economy through potential disruptions.
The Review also underscores the importance of financial institutions maintaining prudent lending standards
and strengthening operational resilience.

2025 Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivative Markets
Number
2025-28
Date
1 October 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia has today released a summary of findings from the latest triennial survey of
turnover in foreign exchange (FX) and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives markets that was
conducted in the Australian market in April 2025. This was part of a global survey that involved central
banks and authorities from 52 jurisdictions and was coordinated by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) to obtain comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of FX and
OTC derivatives markets. Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986 for activity in
FX markets and since 1995 for OTC interest rate derivatives markets.
Globally, the Australian dollar is the seventh most traded currency, down from sixth in the previous
survey, and its share of turnover remained stable around 6 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the
sixth most traded currency pair globally, accounting for around 5 per cent of all transactions.
Activity in Australia’s FX market in April 2025 reached its highest level on record. The survey was
conducted during a period of heightened FX volatility and a surge of trading activity following several
trade policy announcements by major economies. Average daily turnover in Australia’s FX market
increased by 34 per cent to US$201 billion per day in April 2025, from US$150 billion
in April 2022.
[1]
Australia’s FX market remains the the 11th largest in the world.
In the Australian FX market the majority of turnover remained in FX swaps, accounting for around
53 per cent of total turnover. Spot transactions accounted for 25 per cent of
Australian turnover, up from 23 per cent in 2022, and outright forwards accounted for
18 per cent of Australian turnover, little changed from the previous survey.
Activity in the Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased sharply since the previous
survey. Average daily turnover in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased by
123 per cent to US$252 billion during April 2022, reflecting an increase in turnover of
interest rate swaps.
The preliminary results of the global turnover survey are available from the BIS website. The final data
and related analysis will be released by the BIS in December 2025. Links to other participating
jurisdictions’ results are available from the BIS website. More detailed results for the Australian
market are available on the
2025 BIS Triennial Survey Results – Australia
page. The BIS will also
publish global data on amounts outstanding in OTC derivatives markets in November 2025.
Endnote
Australian data are reported on a “net-gross” basis, correcting for local inter-dealer double counting
only. Global data are reported on a “net-net” basis, correcting for both local and cross-border
inter-dealer double counting.

Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision
Number
2025-27
Date
30 September 2025
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent.
The decline in underlying inflation has slowed.
Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to
bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. Both headline and trimmed mean
inflation were within the
2–3 per cent
range in the June quarter. Recent data, while partial
and volatile, suggest that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of
the August
Statement on Monetary Policy
.
Domestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain.
Data for the June quarter show that private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected,
taking over from public demand as the driver of growth. In particular, private consumption is picking up
as real household incomes rise and measures of financial conditions ease. The housing market is
strengthening, a sign that recent interest rate decreases are having an effect. Credit is readily
available to both households and businesses.
Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions have been broadly steady in recent months and
remain a little tight. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected, but the
unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 per cent in August. Measures of labour underutilisation
remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour has been little
changed of late. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but
productivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high.
There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
domestic and international developments. On the domestic side, stronger-than-expected data on growth and
inflation may indicate that households have become more comfortable consuming as real incomes and wealth
rise. If this continues, it may make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases and lead to more
demand for labour. Alternatively, the recent growth in consumption might not persist, particularly if
households become more concerned about overseas developments.
Uncertainty in the global economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale
of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely
to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on
global economic growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat
to the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour
market conditions in the domestic economy.
There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing, the
balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour
market and the outlook for productivity.
Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.
With signs that private demand is recovering, indications that inflation may be persistent in some areas
and labour market conditions overall remaining stable, the Board decided that it was appropriate to
maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the
beginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full
effects of earlier cash rate reductions. The Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious,
updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of
uncertainty about the outlook. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to
international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in
Australia.
The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its
decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial
markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is
focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers
necessary to achieve that outcome.

Assessment of ASX Clearing and Settlement Facilities – September 2025
Number
2025-25
Date
24 September 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia today released the
2025
Assessment of the ASX Clearing and Settlement (CS)
Facilities
. This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank’s Financial
Stability Standards (Standards).
ASX has considerable work to do to meet the Bank’s expectations for an operator of critical market
infrastructure. Recent shortcomings in risk management – particularly the December 2024 CHESS batch
settlement incident – have highlighted that ASX must make foundational changes to its governance,
culture and risk management processes. ASX must also accelerate its uplift of operational and financial
risk management, while meeting key milestones for its major technology projects. Delivering on these
initiatives will require appropriate resourcing and the RBA will be closely monitoring progress over the
coming year.
The ASX CS facilities were rated as having ‘observed’ or ‘broadly observed’ many of
the individual Standards.
The Bank assessed that one or more of the CS facilities ‘partly observed’ requirements under the
specific Standards on the Framework for Comprehensive Management of Risks, Governance, Credit Risk,
Settlement Finality, and Operational Risk. ASX Clear and ASX Settlement continue to be rated as ‘not
observed’ on the Operational Risk Standard, following the Bank’s
out-of-cycle
assessment
against this Standard in March 2025.
The Bank has issued a number of recommendations, including that ASX should:
obtain assurance that it has addressed gaps in its risk appetite statement and strategy to return to
risk appetite
ensure its risk transformation plan is appropriately resourced and implement regular reporting on the
plan
conduct a review of business continuity and contingency arrangement across the CS facilities
comprehensively improve data and reporting controls for financial risk models and address issues
identified in the assessment period.
RBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said:
‘ASX is not currently meeting
the regulators’ expectations for an operator of critical national infrastructure. Resilient and
secure CS facilities are crucial to the stability of the Australian financial system.
‘This assessment highlights that ASX still has more work to do to in strengthening its governance, risk
culture, and frameworks for managing operational and financial risk. We are expecting meaningful progress
over the coming year and will consider further regulatory responses if necessary.’
Background
The Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on
financial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed
on a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards determined by the Bank.
The Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX’s four CS facilities: two central counterparties –
ASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited – and two securities settlement
facilities – ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited. These assessments include a rating
of the CS facilities’ observance against each financial stability standard.
For more information on the Bank’s approach to assessing CS facilities, see:
The
Reserve Bank’s Approach to Supervising and Assessing Clearing and Settlement Facility
Licensees
.
ASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the supervision of CS facilities. In carrying
out supervision of CS facilities, the RBA works closely with ASIC.

Payments System Board Update: August 2025 Meeting
Number
2025-23
Date
28 August 2025
At its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including:
The regulatory response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024.
The
Board reviewed ASX’s plans to ensure the current CHESS is adequately operated, maintained and
supported as a critical financial market infrastructure. Members noted that early progress is being
made and agreed that significant concerns remain. The Board also agreed on further regulatory steps to ensure CHESS
Replacement is designed with an appropriate level of resilience for critical financial market
infrastructure.
The annual Assessment of the ASX clearing and settlement facilities against the Financial
Stability Standards
. The Board endorsed the RBA’s Assessment, which will be
published after it has been provided to ASX, the Treasurer and the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission. Members observed that ASX has made limited progress in addressing the
RBA’s fundamental concerns in relation to operational resilience and risk management over the
past year. ASX’s response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024 and its aftermath
has also demonstrated that ASX must take urgent steps to improve its governance and risk culture. The
successful delivery of ASX’s current risk management, technology and transformation initiatives
is crucial to the continuity of services that are critical to the stability of the Australian
financial system.
The RBA’s oversight of international financial market infrastructures
, including
LCH SwapClear, CME, Clearstream Banking, Euroclear Bank, CLS and Swift. Many of these infrastructures
are engaged in complex, multi-year transformation programs to modernise systems and enhance
resilience. Members emphasised the importance of strong project governance, testing and migration
strategies to support the ongoing safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. Members also
discussed the risks associated with growing reliance by financial market infrastructures on a small
number of critical third-party service providers. The Board welcomed ASIC’s decision to grant
Clearstream Banking a clearing and settlement facility licence. Members highlighted the importance of
the RBA and ASIC, as co-regulators of clearing and settlement facilities operating in Australia,
having sufficient oversight of such facilities.
The system-wide resilience of the Australian payments system.
The Board highlighted
the growing importance of operational resilience in the context of a more complex and challenging
environment for operational risk in the payments system. Regulators and entities will need to increase their
focus on system-wide interdependencies. The Board endorsed an ongoing research program examining
interoperability, third-party and concentration risks, resilience arrangements for high-value
payments and the vulnerability of the payments system to utilities outages.
The future of cash distribution arrangements.
Members discussed the challenges in
the cash distribution system. There is an ongoing need for industry cooperation to work towards a more
durable future distribution system that supports the availability of cash in the community, including in
rural and regional Australia. Cash remains an important means of payment for many Australians and can
play a valuable role as a back-up to electronic payments, as part of a resilient and inclusive
payments ecosystem. Members noted that a new proposed regulatory framework for providers of cash
distribution services, which was the subject of a recent CFR and ACCC consultation, should contribute
to the management of risks relating to the continuity of cash distribution services across Australia.
Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging.
The Board was provided with an
update on the initial responses of stakeholders to the Consultation Paper published in July. Members
noted feedback regarding the potential impact of the proposed card payments regulations on the
ability of small issuers and fintechs to compete and innovate. Members held a preliminary discussion
on whether there is a case to reduce the regulatory burden of card payments regulations on small
issuers and what options might best support this objective. The issue will be considered further as
part of the consultation process for the Review.
Global developments in stablecoins.
Members discussed the recent sharp growth in
the global stablecoin market, noting the market is largely concentrated in a small number of
US dollar stablecoins. Members discussed the expansion in potential use cases for stablecoins,
including as a means of payment and in cross-border transactions. They also considered the emerging
regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. While the stablecoin market in Australia is currently
very small, members discussed a range of potential domestic implications if the use of stablecoins
were to grow considerably. The Board also welcomed the Government’s proposed reforms aimed at
ensuring that stored-value facilities, including stablecoins, operate under a strong regulatory and
licencing regime.

Media Release
Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision
Number
2025-22
Date
12 August 2025
At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to
3.60 per cent.
Inflation has continued to moderate.
Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to
bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. In the June quarter, trimmed mean
inflation over the year fell to 2.7 per cent, broadly as expected in May. Headline inflation,
which has partly been affected by temporary cost of living relief measures, was 2.1 per cent,
also as forecast. Updated staff forecasts for the August meeting suggest that underlying inflation will
continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the
2–3 per cent
range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a
gradual easing path.
The outlook remains uncertain.
Uncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale
of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely
to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on
global economic activity, and there remains a risk that households and firms delay expenditure pending
still greater clarity on the outlook. As in May, the forecasts assume that both effects weigh on activity
and inflation in Australia for a period.
Domestically, private demand appears to have been recovering gradually, real household incomes have picked
up and some measures of financial conditions have eased.
Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, although have eased
further in recent months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in the month of June and
averaged 4.2 per cent in the June quarter as a whole, in line with the May forecasts. Measures
of labour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that
availability of labour is still a constraint for a range of employers. Looking through quarterly
volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak but productivity growth has not picked up and growth in
unit labour costs remains high.
There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
domestic and international developments. The forecasts released today are for the recovery in household
consumption growth to be sustained as real incomes rise. Businesses in some sectors, however, continue to
report that weakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases to final prices. There is
a risk that consumption growth is a little slower than expected, which could weigh on growth in aggregate
demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions. Alternatively, as real incomes and wealth continue to
rise, households might choose to consume more and save less than expected. Labour market outcomes may
also prove stronger than expected, given the signal from a range of leading indicators.
There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how
firms’ pricing decisions and wages will respond to the balance between aggregate demand and
potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and continued weak productivity
outcomes.
Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.
With underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the
2–3 per cent
range and labour market conditions easing
slightly, as expected, the Board judged that a further easing of monetary policy was appropriate. This
takes the decline in the cash rate since the beginning of the year to 75 basis points. The Board
nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty
about both aggregate demand and potential supply. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond
decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and
inflation in Australia.
The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions. In
doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends
in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its
mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve
that outcome.

RBA and APRA Update
Their Memorandum of Understanding to Strengthen Cooperation to Support Financial Stability
Number
2025-21
Date
29 July 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have today
published an
updated
Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU), to further strengthen their cooperation and
coordination arrangements in support of financial stability in Australia. The updated MOU sets out the
RBA and APRA’s respective roles and responsibilities for contributing to financial stability, as
well as arrangements for consultation, liaison and information sharing between the two agencies. The MOU
also sets out specific arrangements for coordination between the RBA and APRA in relation to
macroprudential policy, liquidity support, payments policy and crisis management.
Both the RBA and APRA have responsibilities in relation to financial stability in Australia, and it is
therefore important that they continue to engage closely with one other. The RBA and APRA also cooperate
and coordinate with each other and other regulatory agencies on a multilateral basis through the Council
of Financial Regulators. The Council of Financial Regulators has today published an updated
Charter
.
