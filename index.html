The paper addresses industry feedback and outlines APRA’s revised approach, building on proposals from a
consultation
that commenced in November 2024.
The initiative is part of APRA’s objective “getting the regulatory balance right”, which means to promote financial system safety and stability in an efficient way. It reflects a commitment to support a resilient and adaptable insurance sector by balancing the protection provided by APRA’s capital settings with the risks, while enabling flexibility and innovation.
Industry feedback on draft prudential standards, prudential guidance, and reporting standards is invited by 30 January 2026.
The response paper is available on the APRA website at:

Former director of Nomad Developments Pty Ltd (Nomad Developments), Rohan Rex Greyling of Hope Island Queensland, has been sentenced with making a false or misleading statement to ASIC.
Mr Greyling was convicted and fined $1,000 at the Southport Magistrates Court on 20 October 2025.
Mr Greyling was earlier charged following an ASIC investigation which found that he had lodged a Form 6010 with ASIC to voluntarily deregister Nomad Developments on 20 December 2023, containing a false or misleading declaration that the company had no outstanding liabilities.
Nomad Developments was a Queensland based building company. At the time the Form 6010 was lodged, it is alleged that Nomad Developments had outstanding liabilities of $34,885 owing to Queensland Building and Construction Commission. Mr Greyling was the sole director of Nomad Developments at this time.
Mr Greyling was aware of the debt prior to submitting the Form 6010. As a result of his conviction, Mr Greyling is automatically disqualified from managing corporations for a period of five years.
This matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP) following a referral from ASIC.
Background
When dealt with summarily, the jurisdictional limit for the offence is 12 months’ imprisonment and/or a fine not exceeding 60 penalty units ($18,780).
Directors of companies must ensure the information provided to ASIC and to be recorded on the public registers is true and accurate. Further, directors need to ensure the affairs of companies are in order before they attempt to deregister them.</div>

Deputy Chair Margaret Cole - Remarks to the FSC Innovation in Retirement conference

It’s a pleasure to be here and to have this opportunity to discuss APRA’s priorities for superannuation as the industry transitions to the retirement phase.
This is one of my first public speaking engagements since the announcement of my decision to leave APRA by the end of my term in June next year. It has been, and continues to be, a privilege to oversee the industry at such a critical stage of its history.
The superannuation industry is in a state of change driven by three powerful forces.
The first, and the basis of many discussions at this forum today, is the ageing of the population and the implications that has for trustees and their members.
Treasury has previously estimated that around 2.5 million Australians will transition from the accumulation phase to the retirement phase in this decade.
How trustees respond to the challenge of supporting a sharply higher number of members in retirement will be a true test of the system.
The second is the continued strong growth in superannuation assets. The system now has $4.3 trillion in assets, of which $3 trillion are held in APRA-regulated funds.
That makes it the fourth largest pension system in the world behind that of the US, Canada and the UK, and, by some estimates, is on track to become the second largest by 2040. The expanding asset pool adds complexity for trustees in how they manage, invest, spend and safeguard their members’ monies.
The third force is superannuation’s increasing significance to the broader financial system. The potential risks to financial stability arising from the increased interconnectedness of banking and superannuation are important to understand. We expect to publish the early findings from APRA’s inaugural system stress test, which evaluated those risks, later this year.
When you factor in geopolitical instability, the rise in cyberattacks and fraud, as well as the growth in artificial intelligence, trustees have an extremely complex and fast-evolving operating environment to navigate.
Before I delve into the detail of APRA’s priorities for super, it’s worth reflecting: where did this large complex system, which has become so important to the financial wellbeing of Australians in retirement, first begin?
The introduction of the superannuation guarantee in 1992 was critical to the creation and rapid expansion of the universal compulsory superannuation system that we have today. However, the first employer-funded pension scheme came into being a full century and a half earlier.
In 1842 the local directors of the fledging Australasian Bank wanted to find a way to retain their bank officers. So, they came up with the idea – and their UK-based proprietors agreed – to launch a bank-funded pension scheme.
The scheme was formally approved at an annual meeting held in London in June of that year, with the first report of the meeting hitting the headlines of the Sydney Morning Herald
1
some four months later, such being the pace of international news at the time.
To quote from the Herald article dated 8th of October 1842:
“It appeared to the directors that the most effectual way of retaining the services of their officers would be to create a fund out of which pensions should be granted to those who, from age or length of meritorious service, or physical incapacity, might establish a claim to such a provision.”
But it is what follows that I found of particular interest. The meeting report goes on to say – and, again, I quote:
“It will be some years before a claim can arise to form a charge on this fund, and when that period approaches the directors will be prepared with a digested plan for its application.”
In case of doubt let me assure you such a “we’ll worry about it later” approach would not hold much water with APRA today.
Nor would it align with the spirit of the Retirement Income Covenant, which is central to one of APRA’s core strategic objectives: improved outcomes for superannuation members.
The Retirement Income Covenant – a case for urgency
The introduction of the Retirement Income Covenant more than three years ago represented a major nudge for the super industry.
While the accumulation phase of superannuation continued to require trustees’ strong focus, it was critical that the industry should pay greater attention to supporting the needs of members in or approaching retirement.
A core obligation under the covenant is for trustees to develop and implement retirement income strategies. But a year after the covenant came into effect, an APRA and ASIC joint thematic review identified a lack of urgency by trustees to meet their obligations.
While we have seen progress and improvements since then, there is a clear and growing gap between trustees who are meeting baseline expectations and those who have embraced retirement as a strategic and competitive imperative.
The case for having robust retirement income strategies is pressing. Our data shows that one in five funds have more than half of their members in or approaching retirement. However, over the next 20 years, this is expected to rise to around two in five funds.
The initial thematic review was followed by an APRA-ASIC pulse check survey last year, which explored the progress trustees were making to implement the recommendations arising from the review.
Yet again, we were concerned to find a lack of progress, this time in the tracking and measuring the success of retirement income strategies, despite this being a core recommendation.
Our latest joint pulse check was conducted earlier this year. How much progress has been made, and where there is still room for improvement, will be outlined in the survey findings, due for release next month.
Meeting members needs
Understanding the needs of members, and tailoring support to help them balance the objectives of maximising income, managing risks, and flexible access, lies at the heart of the covenant. This includes providing access to quality information to support member decision-making at the point of retirement.
While some funds are doing a good job at this, we believe there are still many members who could benefit from greater access to easy-to-understand information about the products, services and choices available to them.
Our data suggests that large numbers of retirement-age members remain in accumulation phase products paying tax where, depending on their personal circumstances, they are likely to be better off in the tax-free retirement phase. For example, $99 billion of assets in MySuper accounts are held in the accounts of members aged 65 or over.
In terms of products, APRA is doing its part to support greater product innovation in meeting the specific and various needs of members.
APRA recently consulted with the life insurance industry on proposals to reduce capital requirements for insurers offering annuity products. APRA’s aim is to lower the cost to life insurers of providing annuity products, helping to attract participants and support growth in the market, so that more members can consider this type of product where suitable for their individual circumstances. APRA will commence a second consultation on these reforms shortly and aims to finalise the proposed changes in the first half of next year.
The bigger picture
The oncoming wave of members entering retirement will bring a substantial increase in assets in the retirement phase of super. Our latest estimates are that assets in retirement products will swell from $575 billion to around $3 trillion in 20 years’ time.
Trustees will need to be prepared to manage the significant risk that this represents: Cyber risk, operational risk, investment risk, liquidity risk immediately spring to mind.
The credential stuffing cyberattacks that targeted individual superannuation members at several different funds earlier year were contained. But their occurrence exposed persistent weaknesses in authentication practices across the industry. They also indicated that the super system was in the sights of threat actors.
Unlike members in the accumulation phase, those in retirement can access their super savings which increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks, scams and fraud. A continuing priority for APRA is to ensure that regulated entities have robust information controls in place, including – but not limited to - multi factor authentication for member accounts.
For me, the urgency for planning and action on cyber protections was further emphasised this week by the Australian Signals Directorate. As reported in the media, the directorate has warned that developments in quantum computing could break the encryption used to protect passwords within five years. It’s a sobering thought.
Given the growing reliance on third parties, rapid technological advancements and geopolitical uncertainty, effective implementation of APRA’s operational risk management standard CPS 230 – particularly those requirements relating to oversight of material service providers – is critical to maintaining financial safety and stability. We will continue to engage with trustees to ensure they are meeting their new obligations.
With more assets to invest, trustees are increasingly looking to overseas investment options as well as private unlisted assets to drive returns for members. Increased overseas deployment heightens, among other things, currency risk and increased investment in unlisted assets raises questions about the management of liquidity risk and fair valuation.
Transparency
Greater industry transparency will further improve outcomes for members. APRA is committed to increasing transparency of retirement product performance and the industry’s progress in implementing the Retirement Income Covenant.
We now publish fund-level data on retirement product investment returns and investment strategies. APRA will integrate this data into our Comprehensive Product Performance Package from the second half of 2025-26. This will provide a more comprehensive view of product performance across the superannuation sector.
APRA is also working with Treasury to design a new reporting framework on retirement outcomes, which will commence in 2027. This initiative will enable monitoring of the outcomes delivered to members in retirement in a consistent and transparent way. The next step with the Retirement Reporting Framework is for Government to confirm the scope of the framework, following the consultation undertaken by Treasury earlier this year.
Getting the balance right
Avid readers of APRA’s Corporate Plan
2
will be aware that we added a new strategic objective this year – Getting the Balance Right.
This is about our need to balance our financial safety and stability objectives with competition and efficiency considerations.
Under that objective we are progressing nine actions to minimise regulatory burden.
In addition to the reduction of capital requirements for annuity products which I mentioned earlier, the initiatives include introducing further proportionality, removing unnecessary or duplicative rules, and strengthening data sharing with other agencies.
The world is watching
The push to improve financial outcomes for fund members in retirement is not unique to Australia.
Many jurisdictions around the world are focused on retirement funding for their own ageing populations.
But what does set our system apart from many others is the maturity of our compulsory defined contribution system which supports a constant flow of new capital into the superannuation system.
The UK, which has previously relied to a greater extent in recent years on a defined benefit system, is transitioning towards a defined contributions model. The development of the UK’s Value for Money framework for defined contribution pension funds, has taken into account Australia’s approach and experience.
The strong interest in our system was also evident in my recent meetings with UK pension authorities and regulators and at last month’s International Organisation of Pension Regulators sessions.
Conclusion
In closing, Australia’s superannuation system is, in many respects, the envy of the world.
But we know it’s not perfect.
It introduces complexity at a time in members’ lives when they don’t want complexity.
To keep superannuation a world class system, trustees need to respond to the challenges arising from the three powerful drivers of change that are shaping the industry.
That means doing more to improve outcomes for members in retirement.
Doing more to build operational resilience as the system continues to expand.
And doing more to understand the systemic significance of superannuation, not just at a fund level, but in the context of the broader financial system.
Trustees must be equipped and capable to meet the challenges – both risks and opportunities lie ahead.
Thank you

APRA releases latest Points of Presence Statistics for authorised deposit-taking institutions
Thursday 16 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has released its 2025 authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) Points of Presence Statistics.
The Points of Presence Statistics are a detailed listing of the physical banking service channels provided to Australians, including branches, ATMs and EFTPOS facilities. As the national data collection agency for the financial sector, APRA collects points of presence information from ADIs and publishes it annually.
The latest statistics show the ongoing trend of a decline in physical points of presence over the last year, albeit at a slower rate than previous years. The number of bank branches nationwide fell 4.6 per cent between June 2024 and June 2025. Regional and remote areas experienced the smallest fall recorded since this data series began (1.9 per cent), due in part to a moratorium on regional branch closures agreed between the Government and major banks in February this year.
These statistics do not cover the entirety of banking service channels. Trends in physical banking service channels provided by ADIs should be considered in the broader context of increased usage of digital banking services and the presence of other service providers. APRA encourages industry bodies to work together to provide increased transparency on this matter. For example, as the industry association for the payments system, the Australian Payments Network publishes data on ATMs, including those operated by third parties.
APRA has also concluded its review of Points of Presence data for ADIs. Further details are available in APRA’s
response letter
.

The Federal Court has today dismissed ASIC’s claims against a former director and a former consultant of deregistered financial services provider, Freedom Insurance Pty Ltd (Freedom Insurance), that they allegedly acted unlawfully through their involvement in the Freedom Group’s sales incentive programs. The matter was heard by the Court in July 2023.
The Court did not accept ASIC’s claims that Keith Cohen, the former Director of the Freedom Group, and Robert Oayda, a former Quality Assurance Manager, were involved in alleged contraventions of conflicted remuneration laws between November 2017 and October 2018, through conduct that ASIC alleged prioritised driving insurance sales rather than customer needs. Nor did the Court accept ASIC’s claims that Mr Cohen breached his directors’ duties.

Judgment
Background
The Freedom Group of companies were placed into external administration on 13 February 2020 and later deregistered.
Mr Cohen was a director of Freedom Insurance, a director of Insurance Network Services Australia Pty Ltd (deregistered)(
INSA
), and a Responsible Manager on Freedom Insurance’s Australian financial services licence. Mr Oayda was engaged by INSA as a consultant to deliver services to INSA and Freedom Insurance.
Freedom Insurance was a case study during round 6 of
the Financial Services Royal Commission (Volume 2 - pages 302 to 317)
. ASIC commenced an investigation into Freedom Insurance prior to the final recommendations of the Royal Commission.
This matter is the final remaining action brought by ASIC as part of case studies and investigations arising from the Financial Services Royal Commission.</div>

APRA confirms Westpac has met the obligations of the Court Enforceable Undertaking
Wednesday 15 October 2025
Print

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has determined that Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac) has completed a multi-year risk transformation program required by APRA and, consequently, APRA will remove the remaining $500 million capital add-on applied to Westpac.
Following an APRA investigation in 2020, Westpac entered a
Court Enforceable Undertaking
(CEU) with APRA in December 2020 where it committed to remediating specific prudential weaknesses identified by APRA in its culture, governance and accountability, and address the root causes of these issues. In response, Westpac established the Customer Outcomes and Risk Excellence (CORE) Program and appointed an independent reviewer.
Prior to this, APRA had pre-emptively imposed a
$500 million capital add-on
on Westpac in July 2019 and an
additional $500 million capital add-on
in December 2019.
As APRA progressed its supervision program, a first tranche of
$500 million capital add-on
was removed in July 2024 in recognition of Westpac’s progress in addressing these issues. APRA indicated at the time that the remainder would stay in place until Westpac completed its transition work and APRA undertook further validation work to assess the sustainability of improvements made in prudent risk management practices and outcomes.
Satisfied that this program is complete, and the specific prudential issues identified by APRA have been addressed, APRA has removed the remaining tranche of $500 million capital add-on, with immediate effect.
APRA Member Therese McCarthy Hockey said: “As a systemically important bank, APRA expects Westpac to hold itself to the requisite standard of prudent risk management and governance practices. Completion of this risk transformation program is a vital step in ensuring these expectations are consistently met. Our experience has shown us that effective risk transformation programs may continue to identify legacy issues, and we expect Westpac to maintain its unquestionably strong capital position”.

Louise Angela Medley, of Sydney, NSW, has lost an appeal against her conviction on two counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception.
On 15 October 2025, the NSW District Court set aside her previous conviction, but reconvicted Ms Medley on two counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception while she was a director and sole shareholder of Black Collections Pty Ltd ACN 615 105 345 (Black Collections). Ms Medley was originally convicted and sentenced on 13 November 2023 (
23-309MR
).
The Court found that Ms Medley knowingly engaged in deliberate and dishonest misrepresentations despite knowing that Black Collections was not licensed to act as a debt collector.
The conduct allowed Ms Medley to benefit from the collection of commission monies from Black Collections’ collection of consumer credit debts.
Ms Medley was convicted and discharged on a conditional release order to not offend for 12 months.
The Court noted that the offending occurred almost nine years ago and that it was no longer required to hold a licence in NSW.
As a result of the conviction, Ms Medley is automatically disqualified from managing corporations under section 206B of the Corporations Act for a period of five years, from the conviction date.
The deception occurred between about 16 December 2016 and 13 March 2018.
The company operated as a debt collection agency in Double Bay, New South Wales.
Black Collections was convicted of contravening s 29(2) and s30(3) of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 by engaging in unlicensed credit activities and holding out that it held a licence that would authorise it to collect on consumer debts when it did not (
21-159MR
).
The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP) following a referral from ASIC.
Background
Ms Medley was found guilty of two counts of contravening s192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for contravening s192E(1)(b) is 10 years imprisonment. When dealt with in the NSW Local Court, the maximum penalty is two years imprisonment.
Black Collections was convicted of contravening s29(2) and s30(3) of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The maximum penalty for contravening s29(2) is 200 Penalty units or two years imprisonment or both and for s30(3) is 50 penalty units or one year imprisonment or both (refer:
21-159MR
).</div>

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has released its Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) for the period October 2025 to September 2027. This is APRA’s second Innovate RAP and third RAP since 2017.
The latest Reconciliation Action Plan builds on APRA’s previous commitments and focuses on four key themes:
Creating a working environment that increasingly attracts, retains and develops Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees.
Broadening the impact of our RAP activities throughout APRA’s five offices across Australia and forming local cultural connections.
Developing opportunities for more APRA employees to engage personally with First Nations people and cultures, growing their cultural awareness and contributing to reconciliation more directly in the broader Australian community.
Further exploring APRA’s specific role to promote reconciliation within its sphere of influence - in partnership with other financial regulators - in a way that aligns with APRA’s mandate.
The actions outlined in the RAP are designed to complement APRA’s inclusion and diversity (I&D) strategy and advance reconciliation within APRA.

From risk to resilience: Futureproofing Australia’s insurance sector
Introduction
Good morning and thank you for the invitation. It's a pleasure to return to the ICA conference for my third address.
I’m pleased to be here with my ASIC colleague, Commissioner Alan Kirkland.
The theme of futureproofing Australia in a risky world is highly relevant. Who better to manage the challenges of a risky and ever-evolving world than those who live and breathe risk every day? Insurers.
Risks are on the rise, with businesses facing geopolitical instability, cyber threats and a changing climate. Despite these evolving challenges, communities continue to expect that insurers get the basics right. Each claim filed tests how well those expectations are met. Enhancing consumer understanding of policies is vital, or diminishing trust could undermine the social licence of insurers.
So, it is important that you take the time to ask yourself what is within your control to ensure that those expectations are met, and how you will hold yourself and others accountable to deliver on those promises?
The conference themes of resilience, innovation and leadership are a great starting point to challenge yourselves on how you do that. Today, I will have a look at each of these three industry pillars.
Resilience: get the basics right, every day
Let’s start with resilience. It’s the heartbeat of insurance – helping communities recover from disastrous events, giving investors confidence and boosting communities’ financial and social resilience.
We acknowledge there are many factors that sit outside of the control of insurers alone. Climate change, the need for de-risking, mitigation and addressing cost-of-living pressures rely on a suite of actors including government, the community and other businesses to effect change.
However, you are in control when it comes to how you run your business, manage your risks, treat your customers, innovate your products and, ultimately, build trust and resilience in your industry.  In the past year, the industry has taken positive steps to strengthen resilience through better disaster planning, and commencing work on implementing commitments made in the Industry Action Plan in response to the 2022 Flood Inquiry.
While this work is strengthening the core of your business, note resilience isn’t a ”one and done” exercise, it’s a constant practice of adaptation.
And true resilience rests on solid fundamentals, including, but not limited to:
a strong capital base that’s supported by prudent underwriting and effective risk management;
operational resilience, including third-party oversight and planning for major risk events;
robust and sound claims management capabilities, processes and controls; and
cyber security that keeps pace with evolving threats.
Getting the basics right is non-negotiable. APRA will continue to push you in these areas, but we hope to see insurers proactively holding themselves accountable to ensure their basics are strong.
The implementation of the Financial Accountability Regime in March this year has further increased accountability. Under FAR, insurers must have appointed accountable persons to take responsibility for key insurance functions in areas including capital management, risk management, underwriting, reinsurance and product design.
Embracing innovation
Let’s look at innovation: It isn’t optional – it’s essential. It’s how we futureproof insurance and support a thriving, competitive industry. By embracing effective design and implementation, innovation can improve customer engagement at various touchpoints, while also delivering cost efficiencies that can assist with affordability pressures. Innovations can also make it easier to identify and respond to risks.
The risks we face today – cyber, climate, geopolitical – demand smarter and faster responses. Investment in digital capabilities, AI, and new business strategies will open new opportunities and enhance industry resilience.
AI shows considerable potential in areas such as underwriting, claims processes, cybersecurity, fraud detection, and crisis prevention. It can bring efficiency to your business and in turn deliver greater value to your customers. However, it’s imperative that you fully understand the risks, as well as the opportunities.
While I encourage you to embrace innovation, I have one reminder: solve for the customer – and do this transparently.  What more can you do to help your customer understand why their premium has changed, the factors that contribute to an increasing price and importantly what role, if any they can play to bring the cost down? Transparency builds trust – and trust builds your business.
Leadership: step up – together
That brings us to leadership. In a risky world, leadership means courage and clarity.
Good leadership creates resilience. It shapes a strong risk culture.
APRA’s latest “Insurance Sector Risk Culture Survey” shows what "good" practice looks like:
Boards that drive real change, executives who challenge constructively and staff who feel safe to speak up.
Clear roles and accountability, including proper recognition and support for risk raisers.
And a risk culture that’s embraced across the organisation. From leaders to middle managers, and from back office to frontline teams.
This survey also unearthed pain points for claims and technology staff – areas that need urgent uplift.
The insights from this survey will help you to understand your business and step ahead of your risks. Insurers who address these issues promptly can significantly enhance their competitive position.
APRA: getting the balance right
Accountability is not just something APRA expects from the entities we regulate. It is something we constantly challenge ourselves on. We publicly outline our strategic priorities each year in our Corporate Plan – most recently in August.
In addition to strengthening our focus on aspects like cyber and operational resilience, the latest plan sharpens APRA’s focus on “getting the balance right”. This means promoting system safety and stability in a balanced and efficient way.
APRA is progressing a range of initiatives to minimise regulatory burden for the industry to support productivity. While we have a prudential framework in place that is designed to minimise unnecessary burden, we will further promote efficiency, transparency, and proportional regulation where it’s safe to do so. For the general insurance sector, areas of focus include:
the adjustments of reinsurance settings to promote cost-effective access;
the ongoing review of data collections; and
the identification of data sharing opportunities with other government agencies to minimise complexity and duplication.
Over the coming months, APRA will engage with industry stakeholders to gather feedback on how to strike the optimal regulatory balance.
Sharing examples of duplicative or overly complex requirements will help us improve. I look forward to your insights.
Into the future
Futureproofing fundamentally means anticipating challenges and identifying strategies to mitigate shocks. While APRA does not expect the industry to foresee every possible emerging risk, public expectations for fair treatment remain constant. And, regardless of external difficulties, the requirement that insurers get the basics right will not abate.
Moreover, maintaining a social licence to operate relies on insurers’ accountability in making decisions that foster trust within the sector.
If you master the basics, embrace innovation, and lead with a strong risk culture, you won’t just weather the next storm - you’ll strengthen trust in an industry that is essential to the community and our economy.
Yes, the future is risky. But it’s also full of opportunity. Let’s make sure Australia is prepared.
Thank you. I’m looking forward to the conversation.

Phillip Bird of Alexander Heights, WA, and Daniel Holmes of Beechboro, WA, have each been charged with two offences of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring Sheffield Insurance Pty Ltd (
Sheffield
) failing to lodge financial statements and auditors report with ASIC, following an ASIC investigation.
ASIC alleges that, as directors of Sheffield, Mr Bird and Mr Holmes were responsible for the failure by Sheffield to lodge its profit and loss statement and balance sheet (
Financial Statements
) and auditor’s report for each financial year from 2019 to 2024.
Mr Bird and Mr Holmes appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on 10 October 2025 charged under sections 989B(2) and 989B(3) of the Corporations Act.
As the holder of an Australian Financial Services (AFS) Licence, Sheffield is required to lodge the Financial Statements with ASIC within 3 months of the end of the relevant financial year.
The legal representative appearing for both Mr Bird and Mr Holmes requested the matters be adjourned to 21 November 2025.
The matter is being prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) after a referral from ASIC.
Background
Australian Financial Services (AFS) licensees must have adequate financial resources to provide the financial services covered by their AFS licence and to carry out supervisory arrangements. FS Licensees are required to submit financial statements to ASIC to maintain investor confidence and ensure the accountability of management through the provision of timely and reliable financial information.</div>

Mergers and acquisitions
The ACCC has outlined its preliminary competition concerns with Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd’s proposed acquisition of Telwater Pty Ltd in a Statement of Issues published today.
Telwater is the largest manufacturer and supplier of aluminium trailer boats in Australia and has strong brand recognition throughout the recreational marine industry. Market participants have told the ACCC that a Telwater aluminium trailer boat is a very important product for many dealers.
Yamaha is a leading supplier of outboard motors. It faces competition from outboard motor brands such as Mercury and Suzuki.
The ACCC’s preliminary view is that the proposed acquisition is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the wholesale supply of outboard motors in Australia.
“We are concerned that, following the acquisition, Yamaha would have the ability and incentive to link the wholesale supply of Yamaha outboard motors to Telwater aluminium trailer boats, for example, by requiring dealers of Telwater boats to also become Yamaha outboard motor dealers,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
“This acquisition could make it much harder for other outboard motor suppliers to compete effectively with Yamaha, ultimately reducing the choice and competitive offerings available to consumers.”
The ACCC is also concerned that the merged entity could seek to reduce the access to dealers and customers by rival suppliers of trailer boats.
“Linking the wholesale supply of Yamaha outboard motors with Telwater aluminium trailer boats could limit how effectively existing and future rival wholesale suppliers of aluminium boats and outboard motors can compete post-merger,” Dr Williams said.
“This could ultimately lead to higher prices and reduced choice or quality for consumers seeking to purchase a new aluminium trailer boat or outboard motor.”
The ACCC invites submissions from interested parties in response to the Statement of Issues by 23 October 2025.
More information, including the Statement of Issues, can be found on the ACCC’s website at
Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd – Telwater Pty Ltd
.
Notes to editors
‘Outboard motors’ are standalone systems that are installed to the outside hull of the boat, as opposed to inboard motors which are installed inside the boat’s hull and used for larger boats.
Trailer boats are small marine vessels that can be fitted to a trailer for easy transportation and generally range between 2 – 9 metres in length. Trailer boats can be made from various materials, with the most common being aluminium or fibreglass.
Aluminium boats are primarily used for recreational boating in Australia. Aluminium boats are generally lighter, more durable and generally less expensive than fibreglass boats.
Aluminium boats and outboard motors are complementary products, often purchased by consumers together. The complementary nature of these products is highly relevant to the ACCC’s competition assessment.
More information on how the ACCC considers conglomerate effects can be found in section 4 of the
ACCC’s Merger Assessment Guidelines
.
Background
Yamaha is proposing to acquire 100 per cent of the shares of Telwater from Bombardier Recreation Products Inc (BRP), alongside a property in Coomera, Queensland used to manufacture, fit and warehouse aluminium trailer boats.
Trailer boats are generally used for leisure activities, such as fishing and cruising. Recreational trailer boats typically use an outboard motor.
Yamaha Motor Company Ltd (YMC) manufactures outboard motors in Asia, primarily in Japan, and imports them into Australia by its wholly owned subsidiary, Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd (Yamaha). Yamaha supplies the outboard motors to dealers (retailers) Australia wide. Dealers then supply the outboard motors to end-customers.
Yamaha does not manufacture boats in Australia. YMC subsidiaries manufacture trailer boats overseas for various international markets. Yamaha and a related business have supplied a small number of these trailer boats to dealers in Australia, primarily via a third party Australian distributor. Yamaha also owns the trademarks for a small number of aluminium trailer boat and trailer brands, which were previously licensed to a third party manufacturer and are not currently in use. Yamaha does not supply trailers for boats in Australia.
Telwater manufactures aluminium trailer boats and trailers in Australia and supplies them to dealers, who then sell to end customers. Telwater currently supplies three lines of trailer boats: Quintrex, Stacer and Yellowfin branded boats.
Telwater supplies custom-fitted trailers that are sold together with its boats (branded under Telwater), or loose trailers (under the brand name “Move”) that can be used for any trailer boat. Telwater also supplies a limited number of outboard motors to dealers as part of a package with a Telwater boat and also potentially a trailer. Telwater is a non-exclusive distributor of Mercury outboard motors, with Mercury also supplying its outboard motors to dealers itself and via other wholesalers. Telwater also supplies a very small number of Rotax outboard motors (which are manufactured and distributed by BRP), as part of a package with some of its boats.

John Lonsdale, Chair - Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.
I’d like to begin by acknowledging the new members of this Committee, particularly Chair Senator Darmanin and Deputy Chair Senator Hume. APRA looks forward to continuing to work with the Committee throughout this Parliamentary term.
I’m pleased to confirm to the committee that Australia has a stable and safe financial system, benefiting from prudential regulation and policy settings reviewed and enhanced over many years. The importance of a stable financial system cannot be underestimated at a time of such global uncertainty.
Appearances before parliamentary committees such as this are one of the key mechanisms through which APRA remains accountable to the parliament and the Australian people. Another is our Annual Report, which we tabled to parliament last week.
Our 2024-25
Annual Report
details how APRA continues to deliver on its core purpose of maintaining the resilience and stability of banks, insurers and superannuation trustees. The past 12 months have been marked by ongoing geopolitical volatility and cyber threats. Despite these challenges, APRA’s Annual Report confirms that our banks have “unquestionably strong” levels of capital to protect deposits and support lending; insurers retain the financial strength to pay claims from policyholders; and the superannuation industry continues to deliver robust returns for members, while also making headway in improving retirement outcomes.
APRA’s forward-looking roadmap for fulfilling our mandate is outlined in our
Corporate Plan
, published in August, which outlines our policy, supervision, resolution and data priorities.
As always, our latest plan has a strong focus on maintaining the financial and operational resilience of the financial system and responding to significant and emerging risks.
This year our Corporate Plan elevates “getting the balance right” as a strategic priority. While APRA’s prudential framework has always been proportionate, as required by our mandate, we are sharpening our focus to ensure our regulation remains right-sized and efficient – and therefore supportive of competition and productivity in the economy.
So far, APRA has announced nine initiatives to increase proportionality and reduce regulatory burden. In banking, these include streamlining our bank licensing process and formalising a three-tiered approach to proportionality. Other commitments include promoting access to cost-effective reinsurance in general insurance, reducing life insurers’ capital requirements for annuities, and removing duplicative or unnecessary requirements, especially in data reporting.
Our Corporate Plan also outlines how we are intensifying scrutiny of superannuation fund expenditure and reviewing the investment governance of major platform providers.
To that end, APRA wrote to trustees this week requiring them to accelerate and escalate efforts to safeguard member investments held in platform products after an APRA review found some weak practices in relation to onboarding and monitoring of platform products. Based on the findings of this review, APRA will provide each in-scope Platform Trustee with an individual assessment letter bilaterally and escalate supervisory intensity as required.
We have also published insights into the challenges facing some superannuation trustees in operational efficiency, growth and competitive positioning and emphasised to Trustees the importance of considering these challenges as part of their strategic and business planning.
Another top priority in the months ahead is finalising reforms to our cross-industry framework for governance. This is a significant piece of work; well-governed institutions are likely to be more resilient in times of stress, while poor governance can create weakness that leads to misconduct, losses and failures. We have had more submissions to this consultation than any other in recent memory. We will provide an interim update on the consultation shortly.
In July, we announced we were keeping our macroprudential policy settings, including the mortgage serviceability buffer, on hold. Housing credit continues to grow at sound levels and continue to flow to different borrower segments, including to first-home buyers. Even though inflation and interest rates are lower, we are mindful of ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Further, lower interest rates have historically led to higher credit growth and leverage, higher house prices and often more risky lending. As a result, we are engaging with banks on implementation aspects of different macroprudential tools to manage lending risks, which may include limits on new high debt-to-income lending, or limits on new investor or interest-only loans.
We also intend to further strengthen cyber resilience across all APRA’s regulated industries given the recent escalation of attacks. We were reminded of this threat earlier this year when several major superannuation funds were the target of credential stuffing attacks.
Closely related to cyber security is operational resilience. In July, APRA’s new prudential standard on operational risk management, CPS 230, came into effect. This standard is aimed at ensuring banks, insurers and superannuation trustees can respond to business disruptions that may impact their delivery of essential financial services to the community, particularly in relation to their use of service providers.
Another key initiative will be the publication in coming months of the results of our inaugural System Stress Test, designed to evaluate interconnectedness between the banking and superannuation sectors.
Before wrapping up, I would like to acknowledge the recent announcement of APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole’s decision to leave APRA by the end of her current term next year. Margaret has made a great contribution to APRA since joining us in 2021. Margaret has strengthened our legal and enforcement functions and helped reshape processes to make APRA a more efficient regulator.
With that, my APRA colleagues are happy to take your questions.

APRA disqualifies two directors of Xinja Bank under Financial Accountability Regime
Thursday 9 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has disqualified the former CEO of Xinja Bank (Xinja) and one other director from being or acting as accountable persons of any authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI)
1
under the Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) for failing to comply with their accountability obligations.
Former CEO Eric Wilson has been disqualified for a period of eight years, while non-executive director Craig Swanger has been disqualified for 10 years. They are the first disqualifications under the FAR.
Xinja, now known as A.C.N. 618 937 054 Limited, is in liquidation after
returning deposits
and handing back its ADI licence to APRA in 2021.
The disqualifications follow an extensive investigation by APRA into the impact that “side agreements” between Xinja and some of its investors had on Xinja’s capital position during 2020 and whether APRA was misled in relation to the bank’s capital position. APRA’s investigation commenced in May 2021 and the disqualifications have been subject to review processes.
Between May and August 2020, Xinja entered into agreements with three investors purporting to raise CET1 capital. CET1 capital is considered the highest quality of capital because it does not result in any repayment or distribution obligations on an institution. Xinja represented to APRA that this capital was CET1 capital. However, the transactions involved Xinja entering into side agreements together with share subscription agreements with the investors. The side agreements contained additional terms that undermined the investments’ status as CET1 capital, in turn undermining APRA’s capital regime.
APRA determined the actions of Mr Wilson and Mr Swanger in relation to this matter breached the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which was superseded by the FAR in March last year.
APRA sets requirements on ADIs’ minimum capital to ensure they can absorb unexpected losses in their business and to support financial system stability. It is a key pillar of APRA’s “unquestionably strong” capital requirements for Australian ADIs. Complying with laws and regulations governing capital raising and reporting is a key responsibility of accountable persons of ADIs.
Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said the disqualifications demonstrate that APRA is willing to impose serious consequences on accountable persons who fail to comply with their obligations.
“An accurate understanding of banks’ capital adequacy framework is essential for APRA to protect depositors by ensuring banks have the financial resilience to withstand a crisis. It is vital that accountable entities and accountable persons are open and cooperative with APRA so that it may effectively discharge its responsibilities for overseeing the safety and soundness of Australia's financial system.
“These individuals failed to act in accordance with their duty to ensure Xinja had effective capital in place and to be open, constructive and cooperative with APRA in reporting Xinja’s capital position. These were serious failures and the disqualifications, which are the first under the FAR, reflect the gravity of this conduct.
“The FAR means greater accountability standards for regulated entities, their directors and senior executives, and tougher consequences for when they are not met. APRA recognises that the actions of directors and senior executives shape the conduct and operating culture of the entities they lead. Where accountable persons fall short, APRA will hold them to account,” Ms Cole said.
Craig Swanger
During 2020, Mr Swanger was a non-executive director and an accountable person of Xinja.
APRA found that Mr Swanger failed to comply with his accountability obligations as an accountable person by:
not acting with honesty and integrity, and not dealing with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way, where in response to a request by an external investigator appointed by APRA for documents relating to arrangements with three of Xinja’s investors, Mr Swanger altered documents which he knew would be provided by Xinja to investigators appointed by APRA. The impact of these alterations was to remove content that showed that capital raised by Xinja was incorrectly classified as CET1 capital. Providing all relevant documents unaltered would have put APRA on notice that there had been a change to the investment documents and allowed APRA to further consider how and why those changes had occurred;
not acting with integrity in his involvement in Xinja’s entry into the side agreements with investors where he knew the capital raised under them was not CET1 capital, but would be classified as CET1 capital, and caused the disguise and obscuring of the substance of the capital;
not acting with due skill, care and diligence in raising capital for Xinja that he knew or should have known could not be CET1 capital and did not take steps to stop the capital being erroneously classified and reported to APRA as CET1 capital, and did not satisfy himself that agreements with an investor that required APRA’s consent had been provided by Xinja to APRA; and
not taking reasonable steps to prevent matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential standing of Xinja where he knew Xinja had erroneously reported capital raised as CET1 capital, did not take steps to provide the side agreements to APRA nor ascertain whether capital raised was misrepresented to APRA and did not take steps to put in place adequate procedures to stop Xinja erroneously classifying funds as CET1 capital.
APRA has disqualified Mr Swanger for a period of 10 years.
Eric Wilson
During 2020, Mr Wilson was the CEO and an accountable person of Xinja.
APRA found that Mr Wilson failed to comply with his accountability obligations by:
not acting with due skill, care and diligence where Xinja raised capital that Mr Wilson knew or should have known could not be CET1 capital, which was misclassified and reported to APRA as CET1 capital, in circumstances where APRA was not informed of or provided with the side agreements relating to the capital raising. It would have been immediately apparent to Mr Wilson that there was a significant issue about whether capital raised in accordance with the side agreements could be classified as CET1 capital and he failed to take steps to stop the existence of the side agreements or stop the erroneous classification and reporting of CET1 capital;
not dealing with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way where APRA was not informed of the side agreements and in relation to concerns within Xinja of these side agreements’ impact on the capital that was raised. Mr Wilson knew or should have known of the impact of the side agreements on the status of Xinja’s CET1 capital and failed to advise APRA and/or failed to satisfy himself that APRA had been advised of this issue; and
not taking reasonable steps to prevent matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential standing of Xinja where he did not take steps to put in place adequate procedures to stop Xinja misclassifying the capital that was raised as CET1 capital.
APRA has disqualified Mr Wilson for a period of eight years. Mr Wilson’s relative disqualification period reflects that he did not breach his obligation to act with honesty and integrity under s 37CA(1)(a) of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth).

Mr Wilson and Mr Swanger are also disqualified from being an accountable person of an authorised non-operating holding company (NOHC) of an ADI, and any significant related entity of an ADI or NOHC of an ADI.

The ACCC will not oppose Elders Limited’s (ASX: ELD) proposed acquisition of Delta Agribusiness after accepting a court-enforceable undertaking that commits Elders to divest six Delta stores in Western Australia.
Elders and Delta both supply rural merchandise such as agricultural chemicals, seed, fertiliser, animal health products and related services, such as agronomy services, through their retail networks. Both companies also supply rural merchandise at the wholesale level.
“Our review closely considered the likely effect of the proposed acquisition on competition in each local area where both Elders and Delta have a retail store, taking into account the specifics of each local area,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
"We examined the strength of competing retailers, the particular geographic features and size and type of farms, among other factors. We also engaged with a range of stakeholders including farmers, competing retailers, wholesale suppliers, buying groups and industry bodies as part of our review."
“The nature of competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise is more localised than is the case in other retail sectors, partly due to the differences in farming in different local areas, and the importance of local relationships,” Mr Keogh said.
“Following an in-depth review, we were concerned that the proposed acquisition would be likely to substantially lessen competition in several local areas in Western Australia.”
To address these concerns, Elders has undertaken to divest six Delta stores in Western Australia, and the ACCC has accepted their undertaking.
The ACCC considered, and has approved, Independent Rural Pty Ltd as the purchaser for Delta stores in Dalwallinu and Kalannie, and E. E. Muir & Sons Pty Limited (Muirs) as the purchaser for Delta stores in Albany, Hyden, Manypeaks and Wellstead.
“The ACCC considers that the undertaking provided by Elders addresses the competition concerns that would otherwise arise from the proposed acquisition. Independent Rural’s and Muirs’ acquisition of Delta stores in each of these local areas will create a strong, independent and viable long-term competitor to Elders in those six areas,” Mr Keogh said.
The ACCC concluded that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise in other local areas where both Elders and Delta own retail stores.
In its
Statement of Issues
, the ACCC also identified potential competition concerns in the retail supply of rural merchandise at a broader regional, state or national level, and in the wholesale supply of rural merchandise in Western Australia.
Having reviewed additional information and engaged in further market inquiries, the ACCC considers that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the retail supply of rural merchandise at a broader regional, state or national level, or in the wholesale supply of rural merchandise in Western Australia.
“Ultimately, the ACCC did not consider that the proposed acquisition was likely to substantially lessen competition in any relevant market with the undertaking provided by Elders,” Mr Keogh said.
Further information, including the undertaking accepted by the ACCC, can be found on the ACCC’s public register at

APRA calls for stronger action by platform trustees
Tuesday 7 October 2025
Print
Email
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has called on superannuation trustees to accelerate and escalate efforts to safeguard members’ investments held in platform products.
This follows:
APRA’s publication of a letter to platform trustees today, which sets out APRA’s key findings and required actions following its thematic review of platforms;
ASIC’s investigation and enforcement action relating to the collapse of the Shield and First Guardian managed investment schemes, numerous financial advisers, and Equity Trustees Superannuation Limited (ETSL);
the recent commitment by Macquarie Investment Management Ltd (MIML) to pay compensation to members who invested in Shield via the MIML platform.
APRA’s thematic review of platforms was flagged in APRA’s 2024-25 Corporate Plan and commenced earlier this year. The review included platform trustees collectively responsible for almost 95 per cent of superannuation platform assets.
APRA’s letter:
calls on platform trustees to lift standards relating to onboarding, ongoing monitoring and promoting member outcomes;
outlines APRA’s observations on weaker and current better industry practices; and
requires platform trustees to confirm Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) accountabilities; consider whether they have breached the prudential standards and obligations; and determine a time-bound action plan to lift standards.
“The fact that First Guardian and Shield managed investment schemes were made available to members by some platform trustees has exposed members to the risk of significant loss and uncertainty,” APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said.
“While APRA notes variation in practices across platform trustees, APRA calls on all platform trustees to address any weaknesses and accelerate efforts to lift standards.”
Ms Cole said APRA would escalate supervision intensity to ensure that appropriate steps were being taken by trustees. “We will not hesitate to take robust regulatory action as necessary.”
APRA’s letter is available on the APRA website at:
Strengthening investment governance and member outcomes in Platform Trustees
.
Additional background information
Platforms are a significant part of Australia’s superannuation industry. Superannuation members invest around $397 billion via platforms, which is 13.1 per cent of APRA-regulated superannuation fund assets and 28.1 per cent of choice sector assets. Investments via platforms are also growing strongly, at around 14.5 per cent in the 12 months to June 2025.
Platforms typically provide members with a very broad and extensive investment menu that spans key asset classes and investment options – examples include shares, term deposits, hybrids, credit, and interests in managed investment schemes, listed and unlisted asset classes. Some investment options will be managed by the trustee internally and others will be externally managed by third-party investment managers. Members choose investment options from the platform investment menu, typically with the assistance of a licenced financial adviser.
The key obligations of trustees in relation to investment options made available via platforms are set out in section 52 of the
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993
,
SPS 530 Investment Governance
and
SPS 515 Strategic Planning and Member Outcomes
. Trustees must exercise care, skill and diligence in relation to all matters affecting the fund, irrespective of the business model of the trustee. As part of ongoing supervisory focus on Platform Trustees, APRA will consider further enhancements to the relevant prudential standards and guidance.
From 15 March 2025, these obligations were further strengthened through the commencement of the FAR, which applies to trustees as well as their directors and senior executives.
APRA and ASIC have distinct but complementary regulatory roles relevant to the platform ecosystem. APRA, as the prudential regulator, is responsible for ensuring platform trustees adhere to the requirements in the prudential standards, this relates to the onboarding, ongoing due diligence and monitoring of investment options, as well as promoting good member outcomes. For background:
MIML’s court enforceable undertaking took into account the independent review into MIML’s investment governance undertaken at APRA’s instigation;
APRA and ASIC confirmed ASIC would lead enforcement action in relation to ETSL;
On 27 August 2025 APRA and ASIC convened a joint roundtable with the CEOs for platform trustees.

Telstra has been ordered by the Federal Court to pay a penalty of $18 million for breaching the Australian Consumer Law after it moved almost 9,000 Belong customers to a lower speed plan without telling them.
In October and November 2020, Telstra migrated 8,897 customers on its Belong brand NBN plans from their current plan which provided a maximum upload speed of 40 Mbps to a service that provided a maximum upload speed of only 20 Mbps. The download speed was unchanged at 100Mbps.
Telstra did not tell customers of the change in maximum upload speed in their service at the time of the change.
“The $18 million penalty sends a strong message to all businesses that they cannot mislead consumers by making changes to key aspects of a service without informing customers of those changes” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.
In addition to the penalty, all affected customers have, or will be, remediated by Telstra with a credit or payment of $15 for each month the customer had been on the lower upload speed plan.
The total remediation that Telstra will pay to affected customers exceeds $2.3 million.
“Telstra’s failure to inform customers that their broadband service had been changed denied them the opportunity to decide whether the changed service was suitable for their needs,” Ms Brakey said.
“Misleading pricing and claims in relation to essential services, with a particular focus on telecommunications, is one of ACCC’s current enforcement priorities.”
Telstra made payments to some affected customers prior to the ACCC commencing proceedings. The remaining payments to customers are being made in accordance with a
court-enforceable undertaking
Telstra has given to the ACCC. Those customers will be contacted by Belong via email.
The Court also ordered Telstra to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs. The Court will publish its reasons for judgment at a later date.
Telstra co-operated with the ACCC by making joint submissions to the Court about orders, including in relation to penalties.
Background
Belong was launched by Telstra in 2013 as a low-cost mobile and internet service provider, operating semi-independently in a number of areas, including products, marketing, service, billing and parts of IT.
Upload speed refers to the speed an individual’s internet connection can allow data to be sent from their devices to the internet e.g. sending emails, streaming video calls and conferences.
In May 2020, NBN Co launched a series of new wholesale consumer speed tiers, including a new 100/20Mbps wholesale speed tier, which provided a maximum download speed of 100mbps and a maximum upload speed of 20mbps. This speed tier costs retail service providers $7 less per month than the 100/40Mbps plan on a wholesale level.
The ACCC commenced its
court action
against Telstra on 6 December 2022, and the
Federal Court made findings against Telstra
on 21 February 2025.

Gas supply on Australia’s east coast is expected to improve in the first quarter of 2026, but the outlook still depends on how much uncontracted gas LNG producers decide to export, according to the
ACCC’s latest gas inquiry report
released today.
The report indicates a gas supply surplus of between 2 and 24 petajoules (PJ) is expected for the east coast, depending on what the LNG producers decide to do with their uncontracted gas.
“The Queensland LNG producers have reported a reduction in contracted LNG exports, and now expect to have 22 PJ of uncontracted gas available in the first quarter of next year,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey said.
“Given ongoing concerns about sufficiency of domestic gas supply, the ACCC will be monitoring whether and how this gas is offered to domestic buyers.”
“Despite the improvement, the supply-demand outlook remains tight in the southern states,” Ms Brakey said.
“For the first time, southern gas producers are not expecting to produce surplus gas in the first quarter of the year, when demand is usually at its lowest. This may create challenges for fully replenishing southern gas storage facilities ahead of winter 2026.”
Regional supply-demand outlook for quarter 1 2026 (PJ)
Source: ACCC analysis of data obtained from gas producers in July 2025 and of the domestic demand forecast (Step Change scenario) from AEMO, Gas Statement of Opportunities (GSOO), March 2025.
Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. The quantity required to meet long-term LNG SPAs includes feed gas requirements (such as fuel) required to produce LNG. LNG producers' uncontracted gas has been zeroed out when negative as this gas must be acquired from the domestic market, either as additional gas production, purchases or a reduction in exports which would have a net 0 impact on the forecast.
Gas suppliers and users have signed more long-term supply deals so far this year, for supply in 2026 and 2027.
But the report found, despite this, the total amount of gas secured under these contracts remains below levels seen before 2022. Most of the contracts are for only one year.
Prices offered by gas producers for 2026 supply eased in the first half of 2025, falling by an average of 2 per cent to $13.12 per gigajoule (GJ) compared to the second half of 2024. In comparison, prices offered by gas retailers for 2026 supply averaged $14.33/GJ.
For 2027, the average price under producer contracts was $13.93/GJ, while retailer contracts averaged $14.30/GJ. Suppliers contracted a total of 18 PJ of gas for 2026 supply, and 21 PJ for 2027.
Gas policy measures have not made a material difference for local users
The report also reviewed the impact of the Gas Market Code (Gas Code), the Commonwealth Heads of Agreement with LNG exporters (HoA) and the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM), following the ACCC’s initial observations reported in June 2025.
The ACCC has found these measures may have added some gas to the local market, but, overall, they have not materially improved outcomes for gas users.
“There are limits to what the gas policy measures can achieve on their own if the underlying causes of inadequate supply and ineffective competition are not addressed,” Ms Brakey said.
“In addition, they may also be having some unintended incentive effects and causing inefficiencies in gas supply negotiations.”
The ACCC’s review has found that the 2023 reforms to the ADGSM appear to have reduced LNG producers’ incentives to make a net contribution to the domestic market.
These changed incentives appear to have had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the risk of domestic supply shortfalls.
Further, since the 2022 HoA was entered into, the volumes of gas being offered and supplied by the LNG producers to the domestic market have declined over time, while LNG export volumes have increased.
The ACCC’s
submission
to the Gas Market Review outlines the ACCC’s experience and observations arising from the inquiry to inform government consideration of reforms to promote longer-term gas market efficiency and measures to ensure that, in the interim, the Code, ADGSM and HoA are fit for purpose.
Background
In 2017, the Australian Government directed the ACCC to conduct a
wide-ranging inquiry
to improve transparency of the gas market in Australia and support its efficient operation, and to monitor gas supply. On 29 August 2025 a
new direction
was made to formally extend the inquiry to 2030 and to establish quarterly reporting.
The ACCC’s next interim report is scheduled for December 2025

Optus Mobile Pty Ltd (Optus) has today been ordered by the Federal Court to pay a penalty of $100 million for engaging in unconscionable conduct when selling mobile phones and contracts to hundreds of Australians, and subsequent debt collection in a case brought by the ACCC.
The Court has imposed this penalty after Optus admitted it acted unconscionably, in breach of the Australian Consumer Law, and agreed to make joint submissions with the ACCC to the Court that a total penalty of $100 million was appropriate.
In many instances the affected consumers did not want or need, could not use or could not afford the phones and contracts they were sold and, in some cases, consumers were pursued for debts resulting from these sales.
Many of the affected consumers were vulnerable or experiencing disadvantage, such as living with a mental disability, diminished cognitive capacity or learning difficulties, being financially dependent or unemployed, having limited financial literacy or English not being a first language. Many of the consumers were First Nations Australians from regional, remote and very remote parts of Australia.
“Optus’s conduct in this case was truly appalling, and we welcome the substantial penalty imposed by the Court and the deterrence message that it will send,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.
“During the course of our investigation we heard from many people who had not only experienced significant financial harm, but also emotional distress and fear after being pursued by debt collectors for long periods.”
“A company of Optus’s size should have had better systems and controls in place to identify and stop this sort of behaviour,” Ms Lowe said.
In his decision, Justice O’Sullivan said the consequences of Optus’s conduct were “profound”.
“Numerous individuals experienced severe financial harm, emotional distress, and social shame,” he said.
“Particularly damaging was the heightened risk of losing access to essential telecommunications services when faced with inflated service costs.”
In addition to the financial penalty, Optus has also provided the ACCC with a
five-year court-enforceable undertaking
that it will compensate impacted consumers and improve its internal systems.
Optus’s conduct impacted over 400 consumers and occurred at 16 Optus stores between August 2019 and July 2023. Any consumer who considers they may have been impacted by similar conduct should contact Optus.
Examples of the misconduct included:
putting undue pressure on consumers to purchase a large number of products, including expensive phones and accessories, that they did not want or need, could not use or could not afford;
failing to explain relevant terms and conditions to vulnerable consumers in a manner they could understand, resulting in them not understanding their ongoing payment obligations;
not having regard to whether consumers had Optus coverage where they lived;
selling products and services which Optus knew, or ought reasonably to have known, the consumers could not afford; and
misleading these consumers to believe that goods were free or included as part of a bundle at no additional cost.
Many impacted consumers were supported by local advocates, financial counsellors and carers in trying to seek a resolution with Optus.
“We commend the dedicated and hardworking people who assisted many of the affected consumers, and we also thank the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman for drawing the broader conduct to our attention,” Ms Lowe said.
In the case of Optus’s Mount Isa store, which has now closed, the telco pursued debts in circumstances where its then senior management knew that those debts related to contracts for goods and services that appeared to have been entered into at the Optus Mount Isa Store fraudulently and without consumer knowledge.
Optus’s then senior management became increasingly aware that Optus staff were engaging in the inappropriate sales practices and that Optus’s systems and controls could not stop the conduct. Optus acknowledged it failed to promptly take steps to fix deficiencies in its systems, which allowed the conduct to continue.
Commission-based sales arrangements for Optus’s sales staff had the clear potential to incentivise the inappropriate sales conduct, despite the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code requiring Optus, from 17 June 2022, to have regard to the
ACCC’s best practice recommendations
which recommend businesses avoid commission-based selling because of its potential to exacerbate the vulnerability of consumers.
This case follows similar ACCC action against Telstra, which was ordered in
May 2021
to pay a $50 million penalty for engaging in unconscionable conduct when it sold mobile contracts to 108 First Nations Australians consumers between at least 1 January 2016 and about 27 August 2018.
Examples of the alleged conduct
A First Nations consumer visited an Optus store in a metro area. They were sold multiple Optus mobile plans and services, including two mobile phones, as well as accessories. The Optus sales representative manipulated the credit check, which enabled them to sell the consumer Optus services and products that they could not afford. Despite the details of the sale coming to the attention of Optus’s fraud team, the consumer’s debt in excess of $3,000 was referred to an external debt collection agency. The debt continued to be pursued by Optus for over a year.
In a separate example, Optus entered into four contracts with a consumer who lived with deafness and communicated by Australian Sign Language. Optus staff failed to explain the terms of the consumer’s contract in a manner which they could understand. The consumer was on a disability pension, and the cost of the contracts was more than they could afford. In addition, the consumer did not need and could not use the Optus products and services. It was only with significant time and assistance of the consumer’s support worker that the consumer was able to cancel the contracts.
In 2019, an internal Optus investigation into customer accounts at the Optus store in Mount Isa resulted in a report that stated that the store manager had falsified identification documents and consumer information to create contracts for services, and had used the identities of First Nations consumers who were not aware that their identities had been used. Another report identified 82 contracts that appeared to have been fraudulently completed without consumer knowledge.
After Optus was notified of the conduct that was the subject of the reports, including its senior management at the time, it still referred and sold outstanding debts associated with some of those contracts to third party debt collection and factoring agencies. Some consumers whose identities were associated with the relevant customer accounts were subject to threats of legal proceedings being commenced against them and of reporting defaults to credit reporting bodies. Some customers continued to be pursued by third party collections agencies until as late as July 2024 and Optus had not taken steps to stop that occurring.
The ACCC acknowledges Optus’s cooperation in resolving the Court proceedings at an early stage and providing a court-enforceable undertaking. The undertaking includes:
a 3-year consumer remediation program
changes to remuneration and incentives for Optus sales staff designed to prevent further conduct from occurring
a requirement for Optus to ensure that certain Optus Licensee stores in the Northern Territory, regional Queensland and South Australia are directly operated by Optus
process and system changes, for example improvements to Optus’s complaints handling process for consumers experiencing vulnerability and/or disadvantage, and
a $1 million donation to an organisation facilitating digital literacy of First Nations Australians.
The Court also ordered Optus to pay a contribution to the ACCC’s costs, by consent.
Optus customer support
Consumers who think they may have been impacted by conduct similar to that
outlined in Optus’s undertaking
to the ACCC can call Optus’s specialist customer care team on 1300 082 820 for further information or support.
They can also visit the
Sales Misconduct Response page
on Optus’s website.
Background
Questions regarding the recent Optus outage affecting triple-0 call services are unrelated to this judgment and should be directed to the
Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA). The ACCC does not have a role in regulating or enforcing compliance with emergency call service regulations and other related rules.
Optus is Australia’s second largest telecommunications provider. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singtel Optus Pty Ltd, a foreign owned private company.
In Australia, Optus’s retail stores are either:
owned and operated directly by Optus RetailCo Pty Ltd; or
owned and operated through third party licensees, through Retail License Agreements. For example, prior to Optus buying back certain stores, all Optus stores in the Adelaide region were owned and operated by Mavaya Pty Ltd, and all Optus stores in the Northern Territory, as well as several in regional Queensland, were owned and operated by Suntel Communications Pty Ltd.
On 31 October 2024, the ACCC commenced
court action against Optus
. The investigation was prompted by a referral from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.
On 18 June 2025, the ACCC announced that
Optus had admitted
to engaging in unconscionable conduct and agreed to a total penalty of $100 million, subject to Court approval.

Compliance and enforcement
The ACCC has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against JustAnswer LLC for allegedly misleading consumers as to its affiliation with Australian Ombudsman or Government agencies and the cost of its online question and answer service, in breach of consumer laws.
It is alleged that from about 1 November 2022, JustAnswer made false or misleading representations via a chat widget on its website that consumers could use the online question and answer service for just AUD$2. However, in addition to paying the $2 joining fee, consumers were signed up to an ongoing subscription costing between around $50 and $90 per month.
The ACCC alleges that consumers were not adequately informed of the ongoing subscription fee and suffered financial harm as a result.
“Had consumers been aware that the total price of the JustAnswer online service cost at least 25 times more per month than the promoted joining fee, they may have chosen not to use it,” ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.
“Through its chat widget, JustAnswer offered to connect consumers to ‘experts’ in particular subject areas for a one-off fee of $2. The chat widget didn’t disclose any other charges, and the substantially higher ongoing monthly fee was not mentioned until consumers were directed to a payment screen.”
“The monthly subscription fee was shown in a way that we believe many consumers would not have seen,” Ms Lowe said.
“Manipulative online design practices which guide consumers to sign up for subscriptions they do not want or did not intend to buy can cause distress and financial loss.”
In addition to the alleged price misrepresentations, the ACCC alleges JustAnswer misled consumers by purporting that it or its services were sponsored or approved by, or otherwise affiliated with, the Fair Work Ombudsman, an Australian Ombudsman, or an Australian Government department.
“We consider some consumers may have engaged with JustAnswer on the mistaken belief that their questions would be answered by an independent ombudsman, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman,” Ms Lowe said.
“The ACCC commenced this investigation after receiving large numbers of complaints from consumers who claimed they were not aware of the ongoing subscription charges or who thought they were dealing with an Australian government body.”
The ACCC is seeking compensation orders for affected consumers, injunctions, civil pecuniary penalties, publication orders, and costs, as well as declarations that JustAnswer contravened consumer laws and the implementation of a compliance program.
Background
JustAnswer is registered and based in the United States and operates its business in 196 countries, with more than 700 employees.
It provides a service connecting consumers to subject matter ‘experts’ in areas such as medicine, law, accounting and technology, who are available to answer consumers’ questions. This service can be accessed via
JustAnswer’s website
or its Android/iOS app, the latter of which is not subject to allegations in this proceeding.
Consumers who use a search engine to find information on a particular topic may come across search results with links to JustAnswer’s website. This included search ads sponsored by JustAnswer.
In June, the ACCC published the tenth and final report of its
Digital Platform Services Inquiry
, which found consumers continue to face harms from unfair trading practices including manipulative design operations, such as using interfaces that direct consumers to more expensive subscriptions or purchase options, as well as undisclosed sponsorships and subscription traps. A subscription trap is when a business misleads a consumer into signing up for a subscription by representing that they are making a one-off purchase, or by making cancellation of a subscription difficult.
Consumer issues in the digital economy are one of the ACCC’s current enforcement priorities. This includes work in addressing unfair subscription-related practices, including subscription traps.

Petrol and fuel
Retail petrol prices were lower in all capital cities and on average across regional locations in the June quarter 2025, according to the
ACCC’s latest quarterly petrol monitoring report
.
Quarterly average retail petrol prices across the five largest cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth) were 175.7 cents per litre (cpl), a decrease of 6.5 cpl from the previous quarter. Among the five largest cities, prices decreased the most in Brisbane (by 14.4 cpl).

The decrease in average retail prices mainly reflected lower international prices for refined petrol (largely driven by international crude oil prices). A higher average AUD-USD exchange rate also helped make the cost of international refined petrol relatively less expensive in Australian dollar terms.
Crude oil prices predominantly trended downward in the quarter, as trade tensions impacted financial and commodity markets. Another influence was the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other crude oil producing countries including Russia (together, OPEC+) agreeing to a further unwind of production cuts.
“Crude oil prices jumped in mid-June following impacts from the Israel-Iran conflict, but they settled and decreased toward the end of June,” ACCC Commissioner Brakey said. “The jump in international prices contributed to average retail petrol prices across the five largest cities briefly moving higher in early July, before reducing shortly after.”
The following figure shows the movements in average retail petrol prices across the five largest cities from July 2023 to July 2025.
Seven-day rolling average retail petrol prices across the five largest cities in nominal terms
Source: ACCC calculations based on data from Informed Sources.
Notes: The grey shaded area in the figure represents the June quarter 2025. The blue shaded area in the figure represents July 2025 (the month after the June quarter 2025 ended). A 7-day rolling average price is the average of the current day’s price and prices on the 6 previous days.
Across the five largest cities, seven-day rolling average retail petrol prices increased to 180.6 cpl at the end of the quarter. By the end of July average prices decreased to 168.3 cpl.
Petrol gross indicative retail differences were 16.4 cpl across the five largest cities in the June quarter, an increase of 2.0 cpl from the previous quarter. Gross indicative retail differences are a broad indicator of gross retail margins and include both retail operating costs and retail profits.
Average retail petrol prices were lower in the smaller capital cities and on average across regional locations
In Canberra, Hobart and Darwin, quarterly average retail petrol prices also decreased. Quarterly average retail petrol prices in Canberra decreased the most among the eight capital cities (by 17.0 cpl).
Across more than 190 regional locations that the ACCC monitors, average retail petrol prices (in aggregate) were 179.2 cpl, a decrease of 5.1 cpl from the previous quarter.
“We were pleased to see lower prices across most locations in Australia in the quarter, providing some relief to motorists,” Ms Brakey said.
Retail diesel prices were also lower in all capital cities
Across the five largest cities, quarterly average retail diesel prices were 178.4 cpl, a decrease of 8.5 cpl from the previous quarter.
Quarterly average retail diesel prices decreased in all capital cities. Diesel prices dropped the most in Hobart (by 13.3 cpl), followed by Sydney and Melbourne (by 10.4 cpl).
Retail diesel prices generally follow international diesel benchmark prices, which accounted for the largest component of retail diesel prices.
The ACCC welcomes a fuel price transparency scheme in Victoria
In August 2025, the Victorian Government made new regulations requiring fuel retailers to provide timely fuel price data as soon as practicable, and no more than thirty minutes after a change in price. This follows the government’s announcement of its Fair Fuel Plan earlier in the year. The pricing data is expected to be available to motorists on the Service Victoria app later this year.
“We encourage motorists to shop around for lower fuel prices as there is often a range of prices available,” Ms Brakey said.
“We have long been an advocate of fuel prices transparency schemes. This fuel price reporting and subsequent publishing will give motorists in Victoria access to near real-time fuel price data.”
Victoria is the last jurisdiction in Australia to establish a fuel price transparency scheme.
Annual average retail petrol and diesel prices were lower in the 2024-25 financial year
The ACCC’s latest report also provides results for the 2024-25 financial year. Across the five largest cities, annual average retail petrol prices were 180.1 cpl, a decrease of 15.0 cpl, or around 8 per cent from 2023–24 (195.1 cpl).
Annual average petrol gross indicative retail differences
across the five largest cities were 15.9 cpl, which was the same as the 10-year average, in real (inflation adjusted) terms.
Across the five largest cities, annual average retail diesel prices were 181.9 cpl, a decrease of 18.1 cpl, or around 9 per cent from 2023–24 (200.0 cpl).
The decreases in average retail petrol and diesel prices largely reflected lower international prices for refined petrol and refined diesel.

Mergers and acquisitions
The ACCC will not oppose the acquisition of BGC Cementitious (BGC) by Cement Australia, Holcim, Heidelberg Materials Australia (HMA) and Adbri Pty Ltd.
BGC Cementitious and Cement Australia both supply aggregates, ready-mix concrete (RMX), asphalt and cement among other related products and services in greater Perth.
The ACCC decided not to oppose the transaction after the merger parties amended their original proposal.
“An initial proposed structure for the acquisition of BGC by Cement Australia, Holcim and HMA raised significant preliminary competition concerns for us, particularly in relation to the competitive overlap in RMX and aggregate quarries in Western Australia,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
After the ACCC expressed concerns about the initial proposal, a new proposed structure was put forward involving the sale of certain assets to Adbri.
Adbri supplies cement in Western Australia but does not supply aggregates, RMX or asphalt in Western Australia.
The amended acquisition involves BGC divesting WA Cementitious, including cement assets and some limited RMX plants to Cement Australia, Holcim and HMA, with Adbri acquiring the majority of BGC’s RMX assets as well as BGC’s aggregates, asphalt, transport and materials technology centre assets.
“We examined the amended acquisition proposal very closely,” Dr Williams said.
“In particular we looked at both the loss of BGC as a competitor in the supply of RMX and the risk that Cement Australia or Adbri would use their position as cement suppliers to hinder the ability of rival RMX suppliers to compete.”
“While we acknowledge strong concerns from some market participants, we found that Cement Australia and Adbri would be likely to compete with each other to supply cement to RMX competitors after the acquisition.” Dr Williams said.
In reaching its view, the ACCC found that Cement Australia and Adbri would have significant excess capacity in the production of cement in Western Australia.
The ACCC also looked closely at the margins the merger parties earn at various levels of the supply chain, and the profit incentives that would likely drive their decisions post-acquisition.
The ACCC also considered the extent to which the acquirers would have market power and be able to increase the price of RMX across Perth as well as in more localised markets.
The ACCC found, based on a detailed data analysis of existing delivery patterns and the marginal cost of servicing customers, that rival suppliers of RMX would continue to constrain HMA and Holcim post-acquisition across Perth.
Ultimately, the ACCC did not find that the amended acquisition would likely substantially lessen competition in any market.
Notes to editors
‘Aggregates’
refer to a particulate material used in construction and includes sand aggregate and crushed hard rock aggregates. Aggregates are quarried and used as an input into RMX and asphalt (as well as for some other mining and construction purposes).
‘Cement
’ refers to a fine soft powder made from limestone, clay and other materials. It is used as the binding ingredient in RMX and hardens after contact with water.
‘
RMX
’ is concrete that is produced in and delivered by truck in a freshly mixed and unhardened state. RMX is manufactured from cement, aggregates, water and other additives.
‘Asphalt
’ is a sticky, black, tar-like substance used to pave roads, parking lots, and other surfaces. It's made from mixing bitumen, aggregates and other filler materials in an asphalt plant.
Background
On 11 February 2025, Cement Australia, Holcim and HMA requested informal merger clearance to acquire BGC’s aggregates, cement, RMX, asphalt, transport and materials technology centre assets in WA.
After the ACCC raised preliminary competition concerns with the Initial Proposed Acquisition, Cement Australia, Holcim, and HMA put forward the Amended Proposed Acquisition in May 2025, with BGC’s support, that incorporates Adbri as a party.
The ACCC’s decision relates to the Amended Proposed Acquisition, pursuant to which:
Adbri will acquire certain BGC assets including aggregates and asphalt sites, six of BGC’s RMX sites, two mobile RMX plants and the transport assets associated with those assets and the company’s Materials Technology Centre (excluding cement-related assets),
Cement Australia, Holcim and HMA will acquire BGC’s cement plant and cement transport assets, and three RMX sites.
BGC Cementitious
is a division of the BGC Group which supplies cementitious products in WA including cement and slag through BGC Cement, aggregate, hard rock and manufactured sand through BGC Quarries (which operates a hard rock quarry at The Lakes), RMX through BGC Concrete, and asphalt through BGC Asphalt. BGC Transport owns and operates vehicles, operating out of different hubs used in the BGC Cementitious business. BGC’s Materials Technology Centre is a testing laboratory for cement, RMX, asphalt and related products located in Hazelmere.
Cement Australia
is a privately held 50:50 joint venture between Holcim and HMA. Cement Australia supplies cementitious products and services, including bulk and packaged cement, fly ash and slag products. Cement Australia has operations in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, SA, ACT, WA and Tasmania. Cement Australia does not have any cement or slag production facilities in WA. The operations of Cement Australia are governed by a Framework Agreement which establishes ring-fencing between Cement Australia, Holcim and HMA, placing restrictions on Holcim and HMA from accessing information about the sale of cementitious products by Cement Australia to each other party to the joint venture or to other customers.
Holcim
is a Swiss multinational company that manufactures and supplies various building materials across Australia, including aggregates, RMX and pre-cast pipes. In WA, Holcim owns and operates several RMX plants and aggregate quarries (hard rock and sand).
HMA
is a German multinational company that manufactures and supplies various building materials across Australia, including aggregates, RMX and asphalt. In WA, HMA owns and operates a number of RMX plants and aggregate quarries (hard rock and sand).
Adbri
is an Australian company which manufactures, imports and supplies various building materials across Australia, including clinker, cement, quicklime, aggregates, RMX, concrete masonry products and supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag. In WA, Adbri produces and supplies cement, slag and lime through its subsidiary, Cockburn Cement Limited. Adbri does not currently hold any assets or operate in markets for the supply of aggregates, RMX or asphalt in WA.

Mergers and acquisitions
The ACCC has outlined its preliminary competition concerns with Igneo Infrastructure Partners’ proposed acquisition of Benedict Recycling Pty Ltd in a Statement of Issues today.
Igneo manages the infrastructure fund which owns Integrated Waste Services (IWS), which operates under the Recycle Central brand in the Newcastle region of NSW, supplying mixed building and demolition (B&D) waste processing services. Benedict Recycling also provides these services in the Newcastle region.
The ACCC has preliminary concerns that the proposed acquisition is likely to substantially lessen competition in the supply of mixed B&D processing services in the Newcastle region.
“We are concerned the proposed acquisition would lead to higher prices or reduced service quality for mixed B&D waste processing in the Newcastle region,” ACCC Commissioner Dr Philip Williams said.
“IWS and Benedict Recycling are the largest waste processors in the region for mixed B&D waste, and there are limited alternative waste processors for customers to choose from,” Dr Williams said. “IWS and Benedict Recycling are also each other’s closest competitors.”
The ACCC is continuing to investigate the extent to which landfills are competitive alternatives for customers using the mixed B&D processing services offered by IWS and Benedict Recycling.
“Our preliminary view is that landfills are not an effective substitute for mixed B&D processing,” Dr Williams said.
“Many waste collectors in the Newcastle region have a strong preference to deposit mixed B&D waste at processors over landfill, reflecting reportedly higher costs of landfill disposal as well as other factors, including customer preferences for the recoverable material to be diverted from landfill, where possible, due to environmental considerations.”
As IWS operates a B&D collections business in the Newcastle region, the ACCC is also considering the ability and incentive of IWS to disadvantage rival B&D collection companies after the acquisition – for example, by increasing the prices it charges its collection rivals for mixed B&D waste processing.
The ACCC invites submissions from interested parties in response to the Statement of Issues by 25 September 2025.
More information, including the Statement of Issues, can be found on the ACCC’s website at
Igneo Infrastructure Partners - Benedict Recycling Pty Ltd
.
Note to editors
B&D waste is material generated from the demolition, construction or renovation of residential and commercial buildings, civil projects or infrastructure development. B&D waste is non-putrescible (or ‘solid’), meaning it contains primarily non-organic materials that may or may not be recyclable.
Mixed B&D waste is a subcategory of B&D waste which involves materials that have not been segregated. Mixed B&D waste may involve materials such as bricks, concrete, timber, glass, plastic, plasterboard, ceramics, metal, paper and cardboard.
Background
Igneo proposes to acquire 100 per cent of the shares of Benedict Recycling (the Proposed Acquisition).
Igneo is an unlisted infrastructure asset management business of the First Sentier Investors Group, an Australian asset manager with more than A$222 billion in funds under management (as at 30 June 2024). First Sentier Investors Group is ultimately owned by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
Igneo manages an infrastructure fund that owns IWS, a waste management business, with operations in Western Australia, South Australia, and the Newcastle/Hunter Valley region. IWS provides a range of waste management services including resource recovery, commercial composting, and disposal.
IWS owns Recycle Central Group (Recycle Central), a waste management business that provides waste collection, disposal and processing services for B&D and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste. Recycle Central operates two facilities in Greater Newcastle:
a large-scale waste processing facility, located in Kurri Kurri, 38 km from the Newcastle CBD; and
a waste transfer station located in Cardiff (in central Newcastle).
IWS offers collection services under several brands including ‘Central Skips’, through Recycle Central, and ‘Rent a skip’.
Benedict Recycling provides waste disposal and processing services for B&D, C&I, household and green waste across Greater Sydney (Chipping Norton, Unanderra, Smeaton Grange and Belrose), Bowral and Newcastle.
In Newcastle, Benedict Recycling operates a processing facility in Mayfield West, close to the centre of Newcastle (the Newcastle Recycling Centre).
Benedict Recycling does not operate a collections business.

ASIC has banned Melbourne-based financial adviser Wade Lance Spooner, of MWL Financial Services Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (MWL), from providing financial services, controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business or performing any function involved in the carrying on of a financial services business for eight years.
ASIC found that Mr Spooner gave inappropriate advice to certain clients which was not in their best interests, as he recommended clients invest most of their superannuation into the High Growth class and the Growth class of the Shield Master Fund (Shield) which were high risk investments. Shield also had a limited trading history.
ASIC also found that Mr Spooner, who was a member of MWL’s investment committee, provided statements of advice to certain clients that contained false and misleading statements, implying they would enjoy better returns by investing their superannuation into Shield, including representations that Shield had a higher performing track record against other super funds when Shield had only been in existence for a short period.
ASIC has reason to believe that Mr Spooner is not a fit and proper person and is likely to contravene a financial services law.
The banning order took effect from 25 July 2025.
Mr Spooner’s banning has been recorded on
Banned and Disqualified Register
.
Actions to consider if you are a client of MWL
If you are a client of MWL and have concerns about the conduct of your adviser or the advice you received, you should consider lodging a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (
AFCA
). AFCA is the external dispute resolution scheme for financial complaints in Australia and must deal with complaints independently and fairly. AFCA’s service is free for consumers.
AFCA can be contacted by:
calling
1800 931 678
for free (
9am – 5pm Melbourne time
), or
lodging a complaint online on
AFCA’s website
.
AFCA will consider your complaint if it meets the eligibility criteria.
Important deadline:
In cancelling MWL’s licence, ASIC required MWL to remain a member of AFCA until
25 August 2026
. If you intend to lodge a complaint with AFCA in relation to advice received from MWL you should do so by
25 August 2026
.
Background
Mr Spooner was authorised by MWL 24 May 2021.
On 30 September 2025, ASIC was notified that Daniel Juratowitch and Rachel Burdett of Cor Cordis were appointed as voluntary administrators of MWL on 29 September 2025.
On 25 August 2025, ASIC cancelled MWL’s Australian Financial Services licence, banned one of MWL’s directors and its responsible manager (
25-181MR
,
25-180MR
). Mr Spooner is another former MWL financial adviser who has been banned by ASIC in respect of advice provided in relation to Shield (
25-127MR
,
25-128MR
,
25-146MR
).
On the day the banning order took effect on 25 July 2025, Mr Spooner lodged an application with the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) seeking a review of ASIC’s decision, as well as an application for a stay and confidentiality orders pending the outcome of the ART review.
On 25 September 2025, the application for a stay and confidentiality orders was heard by the ART.
On 20 October 2025, the ART refused Mr Spooner’s request for stay and confidentiality orders.
Mr Spooner’s review application of ASIC’s decision remains ongoing with the ART.
In February 2024, ASIC halted new offers of investments in Shield. ASIC made interim stop orders on four product disclosure statements for Shield (
24-018MR
).
In June 2024, ASIC took action to secure the assets held within Shield (
24-129MR
). ASIC sought orders to preserve the assets of the scheme so that they may be recovered, to the extent available, for the benefit of investors while the investigation is continuing.
ASIC understands that, since February 2022, funds totalling more than $480 million have been invested in Shield by at least 5,800 consumers, who accessed Shield primarily through superannuation platforms, the trustees for which were Macquarie Investment Management Limited and Equity Trustees Superannuation Limited. The investigation to date suggests that potential investors were called by lead generators and referred to personal financial advice providers who advised investors to roll their superannuation assets into a retail choice superannuation fund available on a choice platform and then to invest part or all of their superannuation into Shield.
ASIC is investigating the circumstances surrounding Shield. ASIC is investigating Keystone Asset Management Ltd (in liquidation) (the responsible entity for Shield) and its directors and officers, the role of the superannuation trustees, certain financial advisers who recommended investors invest in Shield, the lead generators, and the research house.

ASIC has made interim stop orders on the product disclosure statements (PDSs) for two classes of units of the TruePillars Investment (Fund), a registered managed fund promoted by T.P.R.E. Ltd.
The interim orders stop TPRE from offering, issuing, selling or transferring interests in the Pooled Unit and Loan Units of the Fund. ASIC made the interim orders to protect retail investors from acquiring products under PDSs that may be defective and not worded and presented in a clear, concise, and effective manner.
ASIC is concerned that the PDSs for the Fund may:
omit information about the investments and terms of the investments of the Fund
not adequately disclose the types of conflicts of interest that may be expected to occur and how these are managed
fail to adequately disclose significant risks associated with an investment in the Fund including liquidity, withdrawals and valuation
fail to adequately disclose the fees and costs of the Fund, and
contain misleading statements about income distributions, loss reserves, liquidity, risk and withdrawals.
ASIC will consider making final orders if the concerns are not addressed in a timely manner. TPRE will have an opportunity to make submissions before a decision is made about any final stop orders.
The stop orders arose from ASIC’s retail private credit surveillance which focused on fund transparency, governance, valuation practices, management of conflicts of interest and fair treatment of investors, conducted as part of its response to Australia’s evolving capital markets (
25-021MR
).
Background
The Fund invests in notes issued by a related party which provides credit for a wide range of purposes including equipment financing, rideshare financing, business and trail book loans mezzanine loans (second mortgage), vehicles, agricultural equipment and lends on a secured and unsecured basis.
At 30 June 2025, the Fund had net assets attributable to members of approximately $14.6 million.
ASIC is able to issue a stop order where a PDS includes misleading statements or does not include:
information about any significant risks associated with holding the product
the fees and costs associated with an investment in the product
information about other significant characteristics or features of the product or of the rights, terms, conditions and obligations attaching to the product
any other information that may reasonably be expected to have a material influence on the decision of a reasonable person, as a retail client, whether to acquire the product, or
where the information included in the PDS is not worded in a clear, concise and effective manner.</div>

On 28 April 2025, ASIC permanently banned Noel Northcott of Hillarys, Western Australia from:
providing any financial services
controlling, whether alone or in concert with one or more other entities, an entity that carries on a financial services business, and
performing any function involved in the carrying on of a financial services business (including as an officer, manager, employee, contractor or in some other capacity).
ASIC’s concerns centred on Mr Northcott’s involvement in the Noon Investment Fund and the Quant Fund, in which Mr Northcott used algorithms to conduct foreign exchange trading with investors’ money.
In reaching its decision, ASIC found that:
In March and April 2022, the Noon Investment Fund lost around $11.3 million. Mr Northcott sent false monthly performance statements to 42 investors in the Noon Investment Fund stating that their investments had increased over this period, when, in fact, their investments had lost 90% of their value. ASIC found that this was dishonest conduct according to the standards of ordinary people, highly unprofessional, and lacking in sound judgement and integrity.
In or around 2023, Mr Northcott made misleading or deceptive statements by representing that the Quant Fund’s performance was higher than it was and that the Quant Fund had operated for longer than it had.
Mr Northcott failed to understand the Australian financial services licensing and compliance regime and is not adequately trained, or is not competent, to provide one or more financial services, perform one or more functions as an officer of an entity that carries on a financial services business, or control an entity that carries on a financial service business.
Mr Northcott’s banning has been recorded on
ASIC's Banned and disqualified register
.
On 29 April 2025, Mr Northcott lodged an appeal to the Administrative Review Tribunal (
ART
) for a review of ASIC’s decision. He also made an application to stay ASIC’s decision to ban him and for confidentiality directions. On 10 October, the ART refused to make stay and confidentiality orders, meaning ASIC could make public its decision to ban Mr Northcott.</div>

The Federal Court has ordered the remaining ALAMMC Group companies be wound up following significant concerns identified by the Court‑appointed receivers about investor funds and the viability of the businesses.
ASIC was successful in seeking the winding up of 13 corporate defendants on just and equitable grounds after the receivers’ reports noted:
Around $91.6 million was raised from hundreds of investors across ALAMMC entities, yet significant funds were misused or not applied to the specific projects investors were told they were funding
Investor funds were intermingled and used across multiple entities, with numerous transactions of concern including payments to personal accounts and loans not aligned to specific projects
Construction activity on most projects was minimal or had stopped altogether
Apart from a small amount of rental income, the corporate defendants appeared to have no other sources of cash inflows, did not generate revenue or trading income and almost all expenditure appeared to have been funded from investor funds
The receivers expressed the view that the corporate defendants are insolvent, with limited to no ability to restructure, and
The receivers also identified potential breaches of directors’ duties.
ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, ‘The decision to wind up these companies has been driven by public interest considerations and the need to protect current and potential investors.’
Control of the affected companies now transitions from receivership to liquidation to better protect investors and enable potential recovery actions. The Court has appointed Andrew Fielding and Helen Newman of BDO as official liquidators to carry out the wind‑ups. The liquidators will now:
Continue investigations into investor funds and company assets
Communicate with investors about next steps, and
Pursue any appropriate recovery actions for the benefit of creditors and investors.
This outcome builds on ASIC’s civil action that preserved assets and appointed receivers over Mr David McWilliams, Ms Laura Fullarton and ALAMMC-related companies in late 2024. ASIC’s criminal investigation into the conduct of those involved in the ALAMMC businesses continues.

ASIC is concerned that many Australians may not have the information they need to make confident and informed decisions about retirement after a review identified a lack of urgency in improving retirement communications among superannuation trustees collectively responsible for millions of members.
ASIC’s review, Report 818
From superficial to super engaged: Better practices for trustee retirement communications
(
REP 818
)
,
found some trustees offer one-size fits all retirement communications aimed primarily at pre-retirees, missing opportunities to engage with members throughout retirement and provide more meaningful support.
ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, ‘Over 1.5 million members are in the retirement phase now, collectively holding approximately $575 billion in superannuation assets, and more than 2.5 million Australians will enter retirement over the coming decade.
‘However, ASIC’s Moneysmart research suggests only one-third of Australians on the cusp of retirement are confident that they will be financially comfortable once they leave the workforce. It is important now more than ever for superannuation trustees to focus their attention on providing meaningful, and timely retirement communications to their members that can meet their needs.
‘Moreover, members entering retirement typically hold larger balances, require more tailored solutions and expect high-touch support. Trustees that can meet these needs stand to unlock powerful commercial outcomes: stronger member retention, deeper engagement, and scalable growth.’
ASIC’s review also found little evidence of trustees tailoring their messaging and delivery methods to meet the diverse needs and preferences of their member base, including those already in the retirement phase.
Commissioner Constant said despite the retirement income covenant (covenant) obligations commencing over three years ago on 1 July 2022, some trustees are yet to address gaps identified by ASIC and APRA (
24-143MR
).
‘The clear message we are sending to super trustees is a one size fits all communications approach won't work for all member groups as it may not provide the quality of information customers need to make confident and informed decisions about retirement,’ she said.
‘Trustees have developed significantly fewer communications targeted at retired members. Most of these targeted communications were more relevant to members in the lead up to, or in early stages of retirement, which given the size of the retirement wave already breaking, is a real missed opportunity.
‘It was disappointing to see the retirement communications practices of participating trustees largely overlooked the specific needs of First Nations members, vulnerable members and culturally and linguistically diverse members. None of the trustees we reviewed developed specific retirement communications for vulnerable members.’
Commissioner Constant said effective data and research capabilities were critical in producing meaningful insights for driving strong member engagement, and removing barriers for vulnerable groups.
‘Some trustees demonstrated how individual retirement communications were tailored to some of these groups and others demonstrated innovative approaches to member engagement, like offering webinars, in-person seminars, TV programs, and radio and social media content,’ she said.
‘However, we saw little evidence of wider processes in place to identify vulnerable groups and adequately support them with tailored retirement communications.’
Commissioner Constant said it was concerning that one third of trustees did not have a formal process that considered member feedback.
‘Super trustees cannot understand member needs if they do not have processes in place for identifying specific challenges faced by diverse groups, particularly the most vulnerable among us,’ she said.
‘Ultimately, our review found that trustees with robust governance, strong data and research capabilities and effective benchmarking are delivering better communications, and in turn supporting better retirement outcomes for their customers.’
ASIC is urging trustees to carefully consider the calls to action and better practice case studies outlined in this report to identify and address blind spots in their retirement communications.
Calls to action for trustees include:
focus on informing members about retirement, rather than prioritising product promotion and member retention
develop retirement communications that are better tailored to member needs, using meaningful member groups and nudges
better tailor retirement communications to the diverse needs and preferences of member groups approaching, and in retirement
ensure retirement communications are accessible to culturally and linguistically diverse members and members with a disability
adequately resource governance structures to execute the retirement income strategy and communications strategy, with appropriate oversight by executive and management-level staff, and
strengthen oversight of external service providers that develop and deliver retirement communications to ensure the communications meet quality, compliance and strategic expectations.
ASIC is committed to working alongside APRA to hold superannuation trustees to account for compliance with their covenant obligations, including by publishing results from the latest joint Retirement ‘Pulse Check’ later this year.
ASIC’s Moneysmart has conducted extensive consumer research with the pre-retiree segment that found there was a need to demystify complex financial concepts, and provide practical, actionable guidance. That was particularly the case for First Nations, vulnerable and culturally and linguistically diverse communities.
Based on consumer feedback, Moneysmart has updated its content pages to assist First Nations communities with actionable guidance on retirement and insurance, and will continue to build out new content to meet consumer needs.

Report 784
Industry Update: Pulse check on retirement income covenant implementation
Background
This review represents the next phase of ASIC’s oversight of Australia’s retirement system, following the implementation of the retirement income covenant on 1 July 2022.
ASIC examined how various Registrable Superannuation Entity licensees (trustees) have been progressing with implementation of the retirement income covenant, with a focus on how the trustees are communicating to their members about retirement in the lead up to, and through retirement.
ASIC’s report provides detailed observations of good and poor practices from 12 participants since the covenant came into effect to 11 December 2024.
The trustees reviewed are collectively responsible for more than 9.3 million superannuation member accounts and $1.14 trillion in member assets. Collectively, they represent 45% per cent of APRA-regulated funds by member assets (see:
Quarterly Fund-Level Statistics | APRA
).
Participating trustees included:
Australian Meat Industry Superannuation Pty Ltd
Aware Super Pty Ltd
Brighter Super Trustee
BT Funds Management Ltd
Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation
H.E.S.T. Australia Ltd
Host-Plus Pty Limited
Legal Super Pty Ltd
Nulis Nominees (Australia) Limited

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) today released its October 2025
Financial
Stability Review
, providing
a comprehensive assessment of the health and resilience of Australia’s financial system.
The Review highlights that Australia’s financial system remains well positioned to navigate a period
of elevated global uncertainty.
The RBA views the largest risks to financial stability as coming from abroad:
High and rising government debt levels in major economies.
Stretched asset valuations and leverage in global markets.
Heightened geopolitical and operational risks.
However, the RBA finds that Australian households, businesses and banks are well placed to weather most
shocks:
Most households with mortgages are keeping up with repayments and have built savings buffers.
Many businesses have established financial buffers.
Australian banks continue to maintain high levels of capital and liquidity, positioning them to
support the economy through potential disruptions.
The Review also underscores the importance of financial institutions maintaining prudent lending standards
and strengthening operational resilience.

2025 Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivative Markets
Number
2025-28
Date
1 October 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia has today released a summary of findings from the latest triennial survey of
turnover in foreign exchange (FX) and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives markets that was
conducted in the Australian market in April 2025. This was part of a global survey that involved central
banks and authorities from 52 jurisdictions and was coordinated by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) to obtain comprehensive and consistent information on the size and structure of FX and
OTC derivatives markets. Similar surveys have been conducted every three years since 1986 for activity in
FX markets and since 1995 for OTC interest rate derivatives markets.
Globally, the Australian dollar is the seventh most traded currency, down from sixth in the previous
survey, and its share of turnover remained stable around 6 per cent. The AUD/USD remains the
sixth most traded currency pair globally, accounting for around 5 per cent of all transactions.
Activity in Australia’s FX market in April 2025 reached its highest level on record. The survey was
conducted during a period of heightened FX volatility and a surge of trading activity following several
trade policy announcements by major economies. Average daily turnover in Australia’s FX market
increased by 34 per cent to US$201 billion per day in April 2025, from US$150 billion
in April 2022.
[1]
Australia’s FX market remains the the 11th largest in the world.
In the Australian FX market the majority of turnover remained in FX swaps, accounting for around
53 per cent of total turnover. Spot transactions accounted for 25 per cent of
Australian turnover, up from 23 per cent in 2022, and outright forwards accounted for
18 per cent of Australian turnover, little changed from the previous survey.
Activity in the Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased sharply since the previous
survey. Average daily turnover in Australian OTC interest rate derivatives markets increased by
123 per cent to US$252 billion during April 2022, reflecting an increase in turnover of
interest rate swaps.
The preliminary results of the global turnover survey are available from the BIS website. The final data
and related analysis will be released by the BIS in December 2025. Links to other participating
jurisdictions’ results are available from the BIS website. More detailed results for the Australian
market are available on the
2025 BIS Triennial Survey Results – Australia
page. The BIS will also
publish global data on amounts outstanding in OTC derivatives markets in November 2025.
Endnote
Australian data are reported on a “net-gross” basis, correcting for local inter-dealer double counting
only. Global data are reported on a “net-net” basis, correcting for both local and cross-border
inter-dealer double counting.

Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision
Number
2025-27
Date
30 September 2025
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.60 per cent.
The decline in underlying inflation has slowed.
Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to
bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. Both headline and trimmed mean
inflation were within the
2–3 per cent
range in the June quarter. Recent data, while partial
and volatile, suggest that inflation in the September quarter may be higher than expected at the time of
the August
Statement on Monetary Policy
.
Domestic economic activity is recovering but the outlook remains uncertain.
Data for the June quarter show that private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected,
taking over from public demand as the driver of growth. In particular, private consumption is picking up
as real household incomes rise and measures of financial conditions ease. The housing market is
strengthening, a sign that recent interest rate decreases are having an effect. Credit is readily
available to both households and businesses.
Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions have been broadly steady in recent months and
remain a little tight. Growth in employment has slowed by slightly more than expected, but the
unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2 per cent in August. Measures of labour underutilisation
remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that availability of labour has been little
changed of late. Looking through quarterly volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak, but
productivity growth has been weak and growth in unit labour costs remains high.
There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
domestic and international developments. On the domestic side, stronger-than-expected data on growth and
inflation may indicate that households have become more comfortable consuming as real incomes and wealth
rise. If this continues, it may make it easier for businesses to pass on cost increases and lead to more
demand for labour. Alternatively, the recent growth in consumption might not persist, particularly if
households become more concerned about overseas developments.
Uncertainty in the global economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale
of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely
to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on
global economic growth over time. Beyond tariffs, a broader range of geopolitical risks remain a threat
to the global economy. This could all weigh on growth in aggregate demand and lead to weaker labour
market conditions in the domestic economy.
There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing, the
balance between aggregate demand and potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour
market and the outlook for productivity.
Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.
With signs that private demand is recovering, indications that inflation may be persistent in some areas
and labour market conditions overall remaining stable, the Board decided that it was appropriate to
maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting. Financial conditions have eased since the
beginning of the year and this seems to be having some impact, but it will take some time to see the full
effects of earlier cash rate reductions. The Board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious,
updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve. The Board remains alert to the heightened level of
uncertainty about the outlook. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to
international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in
Australia.
The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of the outlook and risks to guide its
decisions. In doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial
markets, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is
focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers
necessary to achieve that outcome.

Assessment of ASX Clearing and Settlement Facilities – September 2025
Number
2025-25
Date
24 September 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia today released the
2025
Assessment of the ASX Clearing and Settlement (CS)
Facilities
. This assesses the performance of the ASX CS Facilities against the Bank’s Financial
Stability Standards (Standards).
ASX has considerable work to do to meet the Bank’s expectations for an operator of critical market
infrastructure. Recent shortcomings in risk management – particularly the December 2024 CHESS batch
settlement incident – have highlighted that ASX must make foundational changes to its governance,
culture and risk management processes. ASX must also accelerate its uplift of operational and financial
risk management, while meeting key milestones for its major technology projects. Delivering on these
initiatives will require appropriate resourcing and the RBA will be closely monitoring progress over the
coming year.
The ASX CS facilities were rated as having ‘observed’ or ‘broadly observed’ many of
the individual Standards.
The Bank assessed that one or more of the CS facilities ‘partly observed’ requirements under the
specific Standards on the Framework for Comprehensive Management of Risks, Governance, Credit Risk,
Settlement Finality, and Operational Risk. ASX Clear and ASX Settlement continue to be rated as ‘not
observed’ on the Operational Risk Standard, following the Bank’s
out-of-cycle
assessment
against this Standard in March 2025.
The Bank has issued a number of recommendations, including that ASX should:
obtain assurance that it has addressed gaps in its risk appetite statement and strategy to return to
risk appetite
ensure its risk transformation plan is appropriately resourced and implement regular reporting on the
plan
conduct a review of business continuity and contingency arrangement across the CS facilities
comprehensively improve data and reporting controls for financial risk models and address issues
identified in the assessment period.
RBA Assistant Governor (Financial System) Brad Jones said:
‘ASX is not currently meeting
the regulators’ expectations for an operator of critical national infrastructure. Resilient and
secure CS facilities are crucial to the stability of the Australian financial system.
‘This assessment highlights that ASX still has more work to do to in strengthening its governance, risk
culture, and frameworks for managing operational and financial risk. We are expecting meaningful progress
over the coming year and will consider further regulatory responses if necessary.’
Background
The Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of Australian-licensed CS facilities with a focus on
financial stability and the reduction of systemic risk. Systemically important CS facilities are assessed
on a regular basis against the Financial Stability Standards determined by the Bank.
The Bank conducts annual assessments of ASX’s four CS facilities: two central counterparties –
ASX Clear Pty Limited and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Limited – and two securities settlement
facilities – ASX Settlement Pty Limited and Austraclear Limited. These assessments include a rating
of the CS facilities’ observance against each financial stability standard.
For more information on the Bank’s approach to assessing CS facilities, see:
The
Reserve Bank’s Approach to Supervising and Assessing Clearing and Settlement Facility
Licensees
.
ASIC has separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the supervision of CS facilities. In carrying
out supervision of CS facilities, the RBA works closely with ASIC.

Payments System Board Update: August 2025 Meeting
Number
2025-23
Date
28 August 2025
At its meeting today, the Payments System Board discussed a number of issues, including:
The regulatory response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024.
The
Board reviewed ASX’s plans to ensure the current CHESS is adequately operated, maintained and
supported as a critical financial market infrastructure. Members noted that early progress is being
made and agreed that significant concerns remain. The Board also agreed on further regulatory steps to ensure CHESS
Replacement is designed with an appropriate level of resilience for critical financial market
infrastructure.
The annual Assessment of the ASX clearing and settlement facilities against the Financial
Stability Standards
. The Board endorsed the RBA’s Assessment, which will be
published after it has been provided to ASX, the Treasurer and the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission. Members observed that ASX has made limited progress in addressing the
RBA’s fundamental concerns in relation to operational resilience and risk management over the
past year. ASX’s response to the CHESS batch failure incident in December 2024 and its aftermath
has also demonstrated that ASX must take urgent steps to improve its governance and risk culture. The
successful delivery of ASX’s current risk management, technology and transformation initiatives
is crucial to the continuity of services that are critical to the stability of the Australian
financial system.
The RBA’s oversight of international financial market infrastructures
, including
LCH SwapClear, CME, Clearstream Banking, Euroclear Bank, CLS and Swift. Many of these infrastructures
are engaged in complex, multi-year transformation programs to modernise systems and enhance
resilience. Members emphasised the importance of strong project governance, testing and migration
strategies to support the ongoing safety and resilience of critical infrastructure. Members also
discussed the risks associated with growing reliance by financial market infrastructures on a small
number of critical third-party service providers. The Board welcomed ASIC’s decision to grant
Clearstream Banking a clearing and settlement facility licence. Members highlighted the importance of
the RBA and ASIC, as co-regulators of clearing and settlement facilities operating in Australia,
having sufficient oversight of such facilities.
The system-wide resilience of the Australian payments system.
The Board highlighted
the growing importance of operational resilience in the context of a more complex and challenging
environment for operational risk in the payments system. Regulators and entities will need to increase their
focus on system-wide interdependencies. The Board endorsed an ongoing research program examining
interoperability, third-party and concentration risks, resilience arrangements for high-value
payments and the vulnerability of the payments system to utilities outages.
The future of cash distribution arrangements.
Members discussed the challenges in
the cash distribution system. There is an ongoing need for industry cooperation to work towards a more
durable future distribution system that supports the availability of cash in the community, including in
rural and regional Australia. Cash remains an important means of payment for many Australians and can
play a valuable role as a back-up to electronic payments, as part of a resilient and inclusive
payments ecosystem. Members noted that a new proposed regulatory framework for providers of cash
distribution services, which was the subject of a recent CFR and ACCC consultation, should contribute
to the management of risks relating to the continuity of cash distribution services across Australia.
Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging.
The Board was provided with an
update on the initial responses of stakeholders to the Consultation Paper published in July. Members
noted feedback regarding the potential impact of the proposed card payments regulations on the
ability of small issuers and fintechs to compete and innovate. Members held a preliminary discussion
on whether there is a case to reduce the regulatory burden of card payments regulations on small
issuers and what options might best support this objective. The issue will be considered further as
part of the consultation process for the Review.
Global developments in stablecoins.
Members discussed the recent sharp growth in
the global stablecoin market, noting the market is largely concentrated in a small number of
US dollar stablecoins. Members discussed the expansion in potential use cases for stablecoins,
including as a means of payment and in cross-border transactions. They also considered the emerging
regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. While the stablecoin market in Australia is currently
very small, members discussed a range of potential domestic implications if the use of stablecoins
were to grow considerably. The Board also welcomed the Government’s proposed reforms aimed at
ensuring that stored-value facilities, including stablecoins, operate under a strong regulatory and
licencing regime.

Media Release
Statement by the Monetary Policy Board: Monetary Policy Decision
Number
2025-22
Date
12 August 2025
At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate target by 25 basis points to
3.60 per cent.
Inflation has continued to moderate.
Inflation has fallen substantially since the peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have been working to
bring aggregate demand and potential supply closer towards balance. In the June quarter, trimmed mean
inflation over the year fell to 2.7 per cent, broadly as expected in May. Headline inflation,
which has partly been affected by temporary cost of living relief measures, was 2.1 per cent,
also as forecast. Updated staff forecasts for the August meeting suggest that underlying inflation will
continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the
2–3 per cent
range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a
gradual easing path.
The outlook remains uncertain.
Uncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale
of US tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely
to be avoided. Trade policy developments are nevertheless still expected to have an adverse effect on
global economic activity, and there remains a risk that households and firms delay expenditure pending
still greater clarity on the outlook. As in May, the forecasts assume that both effects weigh on activity
and inflation in Australia for a period.
Domestically, private demand appears to have been recovering gradually, real household incomes have picked
up and some measures of financial conditions have eased.
Various indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain a little tight, although have eased
further in recent months. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in the month of June and
averaged 4.2 per cent in the June quarter as a whole, in line with the May forecasts. Measures
of labour underutilisation nevertheless remain at low rates and business surveys and liaison suggest that
availability of labour is still a constraint for a range of employers. Looking through quarterly
volatility, wages growth has eased from its peak but productivity growth has not picked up and growth in
unit labour costs remains high.
There are uncertainties about the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation stemming from both
domestic and international developments. The forecasts released today are for the recovery in household
consumption growth to be sustained as real incomes rise. Businesses in some sectors, however, continue to
report that weakness in demand is making it difficult to pass on cost increases to final prices. There is
a risk that consumption growth is a little slower than expected, which could weigh on growth in aggregate
demand and lead to weaker labour market conditions. Alternatively, as real incomes and wealth continue to
rise, households might choose to consume more and save less than expected. Labour market outcomes may
also prove stronger than expected, given the signal from a range of leading indicators.
There are also uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of recent monetary policy easing and how
firms’ pricing decisions and wages will respond to the balance between aggregate demand and
potential supply for goods and services, conditions in the labour market and continued weak productivity
outcomes.
Maintaining price stability and full employment is the priority.
With underlying inflation continuing to decline back towards the midpoint of the
2–3 per cent
range and labour market conditions easing
slightly, as expected, the Board judged that a further easing of monetary policy was appropriate. This
takes the decline in the cash rate since the beginning of the year to 75 basis points. The Board
nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty
about both aggregate demand and potential supply. It noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond
decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and
inflation in Australia.
The Board will be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide its decisions. In
doing so, it will pay close attention to developments in the global economy and financial markets, trends
in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board is focused on its
mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve
that outcome.

RBA and APRA Update
Their Memorandum of Understanding to Strengthen Cooperation to Support Financial Stability
Number
2025-21
Date
29 July 2025
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have today
published an
updated
Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU), to further strengthen their cooperation and
coordination arrangements in support of financial stability in Australia. The updated MOU sets out the
RBA and APRA’s respective roles and responsibilities for contributing to financial stability, as
well as arrangements for consultation, liaison and information sharing between the two agencies. The MOU
also sets out specific arrangements for coordination between the RBA and APRA in relation to
macroprudential policy, liquidity support, payments policy and crisis management.
Both the RBA and APRA have responsibilities in relation to financial stability in Australia, and it is
therefore important that they continue to engage closely with one other. The RBA and APRA also cooperate
and coordinate with each other and other regulatory agencies on a multilateral basis through the Council
of Financial Regulators. The Council of Financial Regulators has today published an updated
Charter
.
